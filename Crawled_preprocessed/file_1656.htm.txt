of economic data for the foreign exchange markets now it s not on the level with reports like nonfarm payrolls or the consumer price index but the survey does have relevance worldwide trade between countries affects the supply and demand for certain currencies if a country s goods are in high demand that same country s currency will also be in high demand the key is to find and interpret key data points in the report that are relevant to the overall currency trend and apply them when initiating a position for other reports that have an effect on the u s dollar check out reports that affect the u s dollar tutorial beginner s guide to metatrader the u s trade balance reportsimply the u s trade report shows the difference in value between the exports of goods and services leaving the u s and the imports of goods and services heading into the u s if the trade balance is positive then the value of u s exports is greater than the value of imports coming into the country conversely the trade balance is negative when import values are greater now a positive trade balance report is vital to an economy that is experiencing expansion why higher export growth a driver of positive trade reports fuels foundations for further growth and expansion this is particularly true for manufacturing and industrial sectors however a negative balance report can weigh down an economy potentially placing enormous pressure on a country s currency that s why economists and currency traders always prefer positive trade balance reports to negative ones on a monthly basis in charge of this monthly responsibility is the bureau of economic analysis a division of the u s department of commerce it is the bea s job to calculate all components of the report with the full release scheduled shortly after the end of the reported period this can take time and is the reason why the report isn t necessarily released on a set date or time like other economic reports i e u s nonfarm payrolls why the report affects fxbut when it is time for the u s trade balance release currency traders always look for the report to contribute to their overall positions first foreign exchange investors are always concerned about the implications of the report and how it affects the u s dollar in the long term a more positive trade balance report can lead to higher economic growth and production this in turn will boost the likelihood that prices will rise in response to higher consumer spending and if prices rise interest rates will rise attracting more interest and investment into u s based assets all these things are good for the u s dollar but a negative report would crop u s expansion prospects and decrease the likelihood that interest rates will be raised by the federal reserve moreover a negative trade balance will become a drag on the u s economy taking away from any economic gains in the short term this is bearish for the greenback and will prompt money managers and traders to trim dollar holdings so the report contributes a lot of perspective when considering positions on a long term horizon this is why currency investors will always review the results of the u s trade balance report simultaneously when looking at important data points like consumer prices gross domestic product and federal reserve rate announcements for more on how the imports and exports effect the economy read understanding the current account in the balance of payments and then there s the short term short term investors will consider the trade balance report as it relates to market sentiment this is similar to the long term trader as the report acts as a simple component but it s different in that the investors will use the report as a reason to either buy or sell positions in the currency long term investors tend to trim their larger currency exposure rather than completely buying or selling their positions how it worksto clarify let s take a look at some examples in the eur usd exchange rate with europe s financial crisis surfacing and concerns over a greek default mounting the eur usd had come under selling pressure in the beginning of june short term traders saw the pessimism surrounding the eur usd exchange rate and had already sold short the eur while buying the u s dollar in the two sessions preceding the u s trade report release if the u s trade balance was positive this would be another great opportunity to sell the eur usd pair on june the u s trade balance report was better than expected the figure beat estimates with the deficit shrinking to just under billion now although not positive the contraction meant that the overall trade deficit was improving a dollar positive figure traders referring to the u s trade balance report shorted the resistance level initiating short eurusd positions at resistance of figure and corresponding stops pips above traders were able to capture an intraday gain of about pips a risk reward ratio the trade becomes even more profitable in the medium term as the spot exchange continues to decline to before testing major support fast forward to july and a different opportunity emerges this time on july the market sentiment changed a bit although traders and investors were still concerned about a european financial crisis the u s debt ceiling debate had begun to emerge so any u s dollar negative news would add to already rising concerns of a u s credit downgrade short term traders referring to technical analysis could already see that the eur usd currency decline seemed to be stalling confirmation of this signal would be a break of the descending trendline in the minute time frame figure a penetration of this resistance level would indicate that momentum had shifted and that there was upside potential in the pair figure currency traders initiated buy positions at the retest of a broken trendline barrier and that s just what happened hours before the release the eur usd pair broke through the trendline resistance signaling a move higher short term traders watching this level placed long or buy positions on support of with corresponding stops of pips placed below intraday traders long on this position would have profited nicely as the eur usd topped out at that afternoon giving traders a pip gain a risk reward ratio medium term traders who held on would have seen the eur usd climb to as high as the bottom linegiven these examples it s easy to see that analyzing and applying the trade balance report is necessary to currency portfolio positioning these days without it the fx investor will be missing out on underlying signs of a trend both in the short and long term but those that are able to capitalize on this rather obscure report will benefit immensely
