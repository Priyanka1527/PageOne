investorsâ can useâ diversification to maximizeâ investment returns theyâ needâ to understand the two types of investment risk unsystematic risk and systematic risk unsystematic vs systematic risk unsystematic risk can be diversified away by constructing a portfolio of securities that at a basic level are different or non correlated for example if an individual had a portfolio withâ only one type of stock the portfolio carries a large amount of unsystematicâ risk the portfolio isn t maximizing returns for a given level of risk becauseâ the risk associated with having one type of stockâ can be taken away simply by adding another stock to the portfolio by selling half of the singleâ company sâ stock and purchasing stock inâ a different one the investor reduces their unsystematic risk because their portfolio now contains two different companiesâ in different sectorsâ with different financials on the other hand systematic risk also known as market risk â can t be diversified away for example investors can t control the overall market and its fluctuations onâ a day to day basis â interest rates and whether they will go up or down orâ inflation these are all part of systematic risk the goal of an investment manager is to reduceâ the riskâ within their control to a levelâ aligned with the investor s toleranceâ ofâ their investments to decline in value and their need to achieve a particular return for stated goals it s important for investorsâ to determine what level of risk theyâ are comfortable taking what risk may be necessaryâ to achieve theirâ goals and to communicate this information to theirâ investment manager why diversification matters now let s focus on why diversification matters in our previous example an individual s entire portfolio consisted of one company s stock that individualâ is also employed at theâ companyâ and receives a salary in addition to the stocks awards he receives as part of his compensation from the individual s perspective they may not see the risksâ associated with his cash flow and stock assets all comingâ from his employer but if an unfortunate situation occurredâ where he lost his job or a disabling accident occurred his entire financial situation would be upended alternatively if he sold at least some of his company sâ stockâ and invested in a diversified portfolio of etfs and index funds he d have a much safer cushion to fall back on if something happened but what if the companyâ stock is rocketing upwards a diversified portfolio oftenâ doesâ just as well when compared to the majority ofâ individual stocks just because a particular stock is up year over yearâ doesn t mean the rest of the market isn t for example if the individualâ invested in an index fund of the s p in heâ would have earned roughly while still diversifying hisâ risk across several companies for related reading see the best s p index funds reducingâ volatility diversification reduces the overall volatility of aâ portfolio asset classes experience different stages of the market cycle at different times in the case of the last market recession a diversified portfolio was down on averageâ compared to large cap growth stocksâ s p which were down asâ diversified portfolio consistently performedâ in the middle of all asset classes why diversify if it won t earnâ me the highest returns in any given year over time the compounding of consistent returns and reducedâ volatility of a portfolio can potentiallyâ result in a greater portfolioâ balance than onlyâ investingâ inâ one asset class however every investor is different and past performance does not guarantee future returns if an investor isâ comfortable investing in stocks only hisâ method of diversification may be through owning stock in different sectors market capsâ and geographical locations instead diversifying into bonds or alternative investments diversification helps take the unknown out of trying to pick the best performing asset class on a year to year basis and instead focuses on maintaining consistent less volatileâ and somewhat predictable returns over long periods of time in the process of building wealth taking calculated risks through concentrated positions isn t necessarily a bad thing as long as you understand the risks for related reading see how to manageâ the risk of your own portfolio many of the world s richest people earn their wealth through concentrated positions in their own businessâ or a particular stock however for the vast majority of people it s not feasible nor can they tolerate the risk involved with such investments if investorsâ can t sleep at night because they re worried about all theirâ hard earned money being reduced by defined as a market correction â a natural part of the market cycle what s the point having a diversified portfolioâ canâ grow into significant wealth with time compoundingâ and discipline providingâ enough incomeâ to achieve the goals and lifeâ envisioned ifâ the necessary steps are takenâ to achieve them managing risk diversifyingâ the investmentâ portfolio and knowing what s needed to reachâ individual goalsâ are all part of an effective
