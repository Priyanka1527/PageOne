article helpful share regardless of who you are benchmarking your portfolio to the s p is something we all love to do whether you re a novice investor hedge fund manager or financial advisor we all find ourselves comparing our portfolio return or client s portfolio return to the s p in a lot of cases this just doesn t make sense and can leave us feeling like we re missing the boat which can eventually lead to making some pretty costly mistakes here are three reasons why you may be underperforming the s p year after year and why that s okay your portfolio is made up of more than just u s large cap stocks the s p consists of the biggest publicly traded companies in the united states unless your whole portfolio is invested in stocks primarily u s large cap stocks then you re not comparing apples to apples for the most part any diversified portfolio will underperform the s p in most years but the purpose of a diversified portfolio isn t to outperform the s p but to maximize the return risk relationship for related reading see benchmark your returns with indexes for example if you go back to and compare a diversified portfolio made up of large cap stocks small cap stocks international stocks and bonds your portfolio would underperform the s p of the time however the worst year period for the diversified portfolio was the portfolio would have averaged per year the worst year period for the s p was also when it averaged per year if less volatility and risk is important to you then you must accept that it is likely your overall return will be less than the s p over the long term you are emotional the s p doesn t have feelings it doesn t have emotions or experience fear jealousy or greed on the other hand we all do one of the biggest mistakes in investing is letting our emotions drive our actions for related reading see the financial markets when fear and greed take over fear of a market crash unstable economy or prediction of a negative event happening in the future can lead you to selling at the wrong time jealousy of a neighbor relative or friend who is constantly talking about their great returns can lead you to buy a risky investment or something you really know nothing about greed during a bull market or recent run in the stock market can make you to lose your long term vision by ditching your investment plan to chase returns being emotionless in general is not a trait we desire but when it comes to investing it should be the trait we most seek your portfolio incurs fees the s p does not the s p is not subject to trading transactional or management fees your return is if you re a diy investor you still have to pay the commission on the stock you buy or the expense ratio on the fund you invest in or the transaction fee the brokerage firm charges if you ve hired a financial advisor in addition to the expense ratio on the fund or the transaction fee on the purchase you will also pay your management and or financial planning fee conclusion and recommendation benchmark your portfolio s return to the required rate of return you have established to reach your goals for example if you want to save in years and you save per year then you need to earn annually to reach your goal do what you need to do to earn that rate of return and don t look left or right unless your main objective is to specifically outperform the s p don t compare your returns to the s p it will lead to bad decision making and lower your returns in the long run for more from this author see target date funds understanding the benefit and
