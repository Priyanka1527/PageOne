careers a u s trust wealth and worth survey shows that nearly two thirds have no formal succession plan or exit strategy since most business owners rely on their businesses for income the lack of such planning means that their main source of income could be in jeopardy additionally the study shows only plan to pass the business on to their families sixty three percent of older business owners those over have no formal succession plan business owners don t know how to get the highest value for their business they have no exit plan that considers their eventual retirement many entrepreneurs never plan to stop working not a good plan what if the unthinkable happens others may have a plan in mind but most likely have not have even communicated it to key stakeholders in my experience not having a formal plan leaves a very low likelihood of an optimal transfer or sale of the business whether the plan entails a possible business sale to third parties or a succession to family members business partners or other stakeholders for more see succession planning for your small business benefits of a succession plan or exit strategy the benefits of a thoughtful succession plan or exit strategy are vital to all stakeholders whether they be the founder the employees or the clients who have placed their trust with the firm when they re ready to transition the business owners are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the value of the firm they ve built and help prepare for a smooth strategic exit by the owner or for an unexpected change in circumstance such as illness disability or

benefit you but will also benefit all stakeholders of your company make sure both you and your company have a clear vision if you want to get the most from your business as dr stephen covey said start with the end in mind picture what a success plan and exit strategy would look like and then work backwards this will require soul searching and having a clear vision of where you want to go once you

the value of your business most business owners either don t know the value of their business or may over value the business in order to plan for a strategic exit or succession you must know the value and know how to increase the value to get to where you need to go in terms of your personal financial planning goals although there are many ways to determining a firm s value operating cash flow typically earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda is the common denominator used to establish fair value buyers typically pay a multiple that can be in the range of three to five times ebitda or more based on factors such as a stable and diverse client base revenue growth strong margins continuity of key team members it s worth considering bringing in a valuation specialist or transaction intermediary to review the mix of goals revenue streams expense structure legal structure finances clients and other available information it may also be time to clean up the books as the valuation is dependent on earnings it is important to make sure that the books and records are in good shape for that i suggest a review and or audit by your cpa firm for more see how to
