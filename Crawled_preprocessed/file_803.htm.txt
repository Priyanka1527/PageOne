sporadically rewarding nonetheless mining has a magnetic draw for many investors interested in cryptocurrency this may be because entrepreneurial types see mining as pennies from heaven like california gold prospectors in and if you are technologically inclined why not do it well before you invest the time and equipment read this explainer to see whether mining is really for you we will focus primarily on bitcoin related how bitcoin works and our helpful infographic what is bitcoin why should i mine by mining you can earn cryptocurrency without having to put down money for it that said you certainly don t have to be a miner to own crypto you can also buy crypto using fiat currency usd eur jpy etc you can trade it on an exchange like bitstamp using other crypto example using ethereum or neo to buy bitcoin you even can earn it by playing video games or by publishing blogposts on platforms that pay its users in crypto an example of the latter is steemit which is kind of like medium except that users can reward bloggers by paying them in a proprietary cryptocurrency called steem steem can then be traded elsewhere for bitcoin in addition to lining the pockets of miners mining serves a second and vital purpose it is the only way to release new cryptocurrency into circulation in other words miners are basically minting currency for example as of the time of writing this piece there were about million bitcoin in circulation aside from the coins minted via the genesis block the very first block created by bitcoin founder satoshi nakamoto himself every single one of those bitcoin came into being because of miners in the absence of miners bitcoin would still exist and be usable but there would never be any additional bitcoin there will come a time when bitcoin mining ends per the bitcoin protocol the number of bitcoin will be capped at million related reading what happens to bitcoin after all million are mined how much can a miner earn from mining bitcoin bitcoin are mined in units called blocks as of the time of writing the reward for completing a block is bitcoin at today s price of about per bitcoin this means you d earn x when bitcoin was first mined in mining one block would earn you btc in this was halved to btc in this was halved to the current level of btc in or so the reward size will be halved again to btc if you want to keep track of precisely when these halvings will occur you can consult the bitcoin clock which updates this information in real time source bitcoinclock com how many blocks have been mined so far a number of sites including blockchain info will give you that information in real time at the time of writing we are at block what are miners doing that s so important that they get free bitcoin miners are getting paid for their work as auditors they are doing the work of verifying previous bitcoin transactions this convention is meant to keep bitcoin users honest and was conceived by bitcoin s founder satoshi nakamoto by verifying transactions miners are helping to prevent the double spending problem double spending means as the name suggests that a bitcoin user is illicitly spending the same money twice with physical currency this isn t an issue once you hand someone a greenback bill to buy a bottle of vodka you no longer have it so there s no danger you could use that same to buy lotto tickets next door with digital currency however as the investopedia dictionary explains there is a risk that the holder could make a copy of the digital token and send it to a merchant or another party while retaining the original let s say you had one legit and one really good photocopy of that same if someone were to try to spend both the real bill and the fake one someone who took the trouble of looking at both of the bills serial numbers would see that they were the same number and thus one of them had to be false what a bitcoin miner does is analogous to that they check transactions to make sure that users have not illegitimately tried to spend the same bitcoin twice this isn t a perfect analogy we ll explain in more detail below once a miner has verified mb megabyte worth of bitcoin transactions they are eligible to win the btc the mb limit was set by satoshi nakamoto and is a matter of controversy as some miners believe the block size should be increased to accommodate more data note that i said that verifying mb worth of transactions makes a miner eligible to earn bitcoin not everyone who verifies transactions will get paid out mb of transactions can theoretically be as small as transaction though this is not at all common or several thousand it depends on how much data the transactions take up so after all that work of verifying transactions i might still not get any bitcoin for it that is correct in order to earn bitcoin you need to meet two conditions one is a matter of effort one is a matter of luck you have to verify mb worth of transactions this is the easy part you have to be the first miner to arrive at the right answer to a numeric problem this process is also known as a proof of work what do you mean the right answer to a numeric problem the good news no advanced math or computation is involved you may have heard that miners are solving difficult mathematical problems that s not true at all what they re actually doing is trying to be the first miner to come up with a digit hexadecimal number a hash that is less than or equal to the target hash it s basically guess work the bad news because it s guesswork you need a lot of computing power in order to get there first to mine successfully you need to have a high hash rate which is measured in terms of megahashes per second mh s gigahashes per second gh s and terahashes per second th s that is a great many hashes if you want to estimate how much bitcoin you could mine with your mining rig s hash rate the site cryptocompare offers a helpful calculator what equipment do i need to mine either a gpu graphics processing unit miner or an application specific integrated circuit asic miner these can run from to the tens of thousands some miners particularly ethereum miners buy individual graphics cards as a low cost way to cobble together mining operations the photo below is a makeshift home made mining machine the graphics cards are those rectangular blocks with whirring circles note the sandwich twist ties holding the graphics cards to the metal pole this is probably not the most efficient way to mine and as you can guess many miners are in it as much for the fun and challenge as for the money source shutterstock the eli explain it like i m five version of what bitcoin miners do example i tell three friends that i m thinking of a number between and and i write that number on a piece of paper and seal it in an envelope my friends don t have to guess the exact number they just have to be the first person to guess any number that is less than or equal to the number i am thinking of and there is no limit to how many guesses they get let s say i m thinking of the number if friend a guesses they lose because if friend b guesses and friend c guesses then they ve both theoretically arrived at viable answers because and there is no extra credit for friend b even though b s answer was closer to the target answer of if b and c both answer simultaneously then the eli analogy breaks down in bitcoin terms simultaneous answers occur frequently but at the end of the day there can only be one winning answer when multiple simultaneous answers are presented that are equal to or less than the target number the bitcoin network will decide by a simple majority which miner to honour typically it is the miner who has done the most work i e verifies the most transactions the losing block then becomes an orphan block now imagine that i pose the guess what number i m thinking of question but i m not asking just three friends and i m not thinking of a number between and rather i m asking millions of would be miners and i m thinking of a digit hexadecimal number now you see that it s going to be extremely hard to guess the right answer see also what is bitcoin mining what the hell is a digit hexadecimal number well here is one fcc cf d e c e f ac e df ee the number above has digits easy enough to understand so far as you probably noticed that number consists not just of numbers but also letters of the alphabet why is that in order to understand what these letters are doing in the middle of numbers let s unpack the word hexadecimal as you know we use the decimal system which means it is base this in turn means that every digit has possibilities i will be rather alarmed if these do not look familiar to you hexadecimal on the other hand means base as hex is derived from the greek word for and deca is derived from the greek word for in a hexadecimal system each digit has possibilities but our numeric system only offers ways of representing numbers that s why you have to stick letters in specifically letters a b c d e and f in a hexadecimal system these are the values of each digit the above chart is just for background if you are mining bitcoin you do not need to calculate the total value of that digit number the hash i repeat you do not need to calculate the total value of a hash thanks a lot so what do digit hexadecimal numbers have to do with bitcoin mining remember that eli analogy where i wrote the number on a piece of paper and put it in a sealed envelope in bitcoin mining terms that metaphorical undisclosed number in the envelope is called the target hash what miners are doing with those huge computers and dozens of cooling fans is guessing at the target hash miners make these guesses by randomly generating as many nonces as possible as fast as possible a nonce is short for number only used once and the nonce is the key to generating these bit hexadecimal numbers i keep talking about in bitcoin mining a nonce is bits in size much smaller than the hash which is bits the first miner whose nonce generates a hash that is less than or equal to the target hash is awarded credit for completing that block and is awarded the spoils of btc in theory you could achieve the same goal by rolling a sided die times to arrive at random numbers but why on earth would you want to do that the screenshot below taken from the site blockchain info might help you put all this information together at a glance you are looking at a summary of everything that happened when block was mined the nonce that generated the winning hash was the target hash is shown on top the term relayed by antpool refers to the fact that this particular block was completed by antpool one of the more successful mining pools as you see here their contribution to the bitcoin community is that they confirmed transactions for this block if you really want to see all of those transactions for this block go to this page and scroll down to the heading transactions source blockchain info ok so how do i guess at the target hash all target hashes begin with zeros at least eight zeros and up to zeros there is no minimum target but there is a maximum target set by the bitcoin protocol no target can be greater than this number ffff here are some examples of randomized hashes and the criteria for whether they will lead to success for the miner note these are made up hashes how do i maximize my chances of guessing the target hash before anyone else does you d have to get a fast mining rig or more realistically join a mining pool a group of miners who combine their computing power and split the mined bitcoin mining pools are comparable to those powerball clubs whose members buy lottery tickets en masse and agree to share any winnings a disproportionately large number of blocks are mined by pools rather than by individual miners in other words it s literally just a numbers game you cannot guess the pattern or make a prediction based on previous target hashes the difficulty level of the most recent block at the time of writing is i e the chance of any given nonce producing a hash below the target is in less than in trillion how do i decide whether bitcoin will be profitable for me the aforementioned site cryptocompare offers a helpful calculator that allows you to plug in numbers such as your hash speed electricity costs etc to estimate the costs and benefits source cryptocompare i ve done the math forget mining is there a less onerous way to profit from the crypto boom sure as discussed the easiest way to acquire bitcoin is to buy it on an exchange like coinbase com alternately you can always leverage the pickaxe strategy this is based on the old saw that during the california gold rush the smart investment was not to pan for gold but rather to make the pickaxes used for mining or to put it in modern terms invest in the companies that manufacture those pickaxes in a crypto context the pickaxe equivalent would be a company that manufactures equpiment used for bitcoin mining you can look into companies that make asics miners or gpu miners companies that manufacture these products
