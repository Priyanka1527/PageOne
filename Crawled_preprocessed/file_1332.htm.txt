outcome of u s presidential election began to come into focus markets around the world fell sharply even u s stock futures fell signaling a tough morning was ahead of us but by a m eastern time investors had begun to assess the short term positives of a trump administration since that time u s stocks have surged around the question on many investors minds is this are there logical and substantive underpinnings to this rally the answer to this question is generally yes at least in the short term beyond that unpredictability seems to be the only thing that is predictable sabre rattling with china and other trading partners may ultimately cause the market some indigestion but for now investors are focusing on several other factors deregulation corporate tax reform and infrastructure spending we ll address each of these to see how they might continue to underpin stock valuations or conversely prove to be a temporary phenomenon for related reading see how will trump shape america s economy deregulation market action since the election makes it clear that investors expect the controls on the financial sector to be greatly reduced in fact shares of goldman sachs have appreciated to such a degree that the performance of this one company accounted for almost one third of the rise in the dow jones industrial average djia it s premature to assess what form this deregulation might take throughout history a wide open banking system has led to excesses that end badly have we learned our lesson about that probably not if nothing else rising interest rates are a net positive for the financial sector for related reading see the most important effects of rising interest rates environmental regulation is another area likely to get some attention or be allowed to atrophy under the new administration neglecting the clean power plan will benefit some electric utility companies with large coal fired portfolios at the macro level however this seems unlikely to be a huge factor in the direction of the financial markets as a whole unfortunately investors actions are collectively amoral usually failing to incorporate long term societal issues the heat can be slowly turned up on the pot and we ll fail to notice paying more attention to the noise flash and earnings posted each quarter the good news is that hundreds of companies have recommitted themselves to invest in carbon reduction strategies and renewable energy because they make good business sense independently of the party in power for related reading see will renewable energy suffer from trump win tax reform this is the big dog in my opinion trillions of dollars are stashed in overseas subsidiaries of u s companies even some sort of temporary amnesty could cause those funds to flow back into the u s if even a fraction of these dollars are permanently invested in u s operations or stock buy backs it could be quite a stimulus to the economy and the market a longer term plan to reform the tax code could have both positive and negative implications most economists have asserted that draconian changes to the tax code would balloon the deficit something that republicans in the house of representatives have long railed against in other words talk is cheap real tax reform has been elusive over the years but from a shareholder perspective any action to reduce corporate tax rates is unequivocally positive for corporate earnings we discuss this further below in real numbers for related reading see do u s high corporate tax rates hurt americans infrastructure this third element might be the one least likely to underpin the rally longer term a narrow segment of the market benefits from spending on bridges airports highways etc while good for employment with the unemployment rate under it s hard to see how infrastructure spending will be a policy priority in fact the u s economy is growing at more than the fed is raising rates and the strong dollar is starting to put pressure on u s exporters the economy doesn t need stimulus right now so the bond market s reaction is highly logical rising rates at the intermediate and longer end of the yield curve the bond market is saying that the inflation genie is starting to leave the bottle wages are finally rising and once the genie s out it s hard to put back in valuations after weak earnings for the past year or more stocks look expensive when looking backward the s p is selling for times trailing month earnings clearly this is on the very high side of history looking to the next months however stocks are more fairly valued at about times earnings and when one factors in the potential impact of lower corporate tax rates the picture brightens further some analysts expect a improvement on s p earnings on lower tax rates alone putting stocks at closer to times earnings even after the rally u s stocks look solid given the positive economic and earnings outlook and the prospect for lower tax rates consumers are feeling pretty good too the university of michigan consumer confidence survey is now at higher than during the housing boom so what is the fly in the ointment excessive optimism perhaps there is very little bearish activity in the market right now which is usually a bad sign moves this fast usually retrace themselves somewhat and to be honest no one really has any idea how far these policies will progress it s all speculation at this point for now the trend is investors friend but we ll be looking at client positions relative to their strategic plans to see if maybe we shouldn t skim off some of the cream for related reading see key indicators that move the markets sadler b scott atlanta gawww boardwalkcm com was this article helpful investopedia does not provide tax
