metrics for spotting quality investments but in spite of its importance the metric doesn t get the same level of interest and exposure as indicators like the p e or roe ratios admittedly investors can t just pull roic straight off a financial document like they can with better known performance ratios calculating roic requires a bit more work but for those eager to learn just how much profit and hence true value a company is producing calculating the roic is well worth the effort tutorial fundamental analysisimportant mainly for assessing companies in industries that invest a large amount of capital such as oil and gas players semiconductor chip companies and even food giants roic is a telling gauge for comparing the relative profitability levels of companies for many industrial sectors roic is the preferred benchmark for comparing performance in fact if investors were forced to rely on a sole ratio which we do not recommend they would be best off choosing roic there are many indicators for ranking a corporation s success learn more in measuring company efficiency the calculationsdefined as the cash rate of return on capital that a company has invested roic shows how much cash is going out of a business in relation to how much is coming in in an nutshell roic is the measure of cash on cash yield and the effectiveness of the company s employment of capital the formula looks like this roic net operating profits after tax nopat invested capital at first glance the formula looks simple but in the complex financial statements published by companies generating an accurate number from the formula can be trickier than it appears to keep things simple start with invested capital the formula s denominator representing all the cash that investors have put into the company invested capital is derived from the assets and liabilities portions of the balance sheet as follows invested capital total assets less cash short term investments long term investments non interest bearing current liabilities now investors turn to the income statement to determine the numerator which is after tax operating profits or nopat sometimes nopat is the same as net income for many companies especially bigger ones some net income comes from outside investments in which case net income does not reflect the profitability of operating activities reported net income needs to be adjusted to represent operations more accurately at the same time the published net income figure also may include non cash items that need to be added and subtracted from nopat to reflect true cash yield for the purpose of showing all of a company s cash profits from the capital it invests nopat is calculated as the following nopat reported net income investment and interest income tax shield from interest expenses effective tax rate x interest expense goodwill amortization non recurring costs plus interest expenses tax paid on investments and interest income effective tax rate x investment income interpreting roicif the final roic figure which is expressed as a percentage is greater than the company s working asset cost of capital or wacc the company is creating value for investors the wacc represents the minimum rate of return risk adjusted at which a company produces value for its investors let s say a company produces a roic of and has a cost of capital of that means the company has created nine cents of value for every dollar that it invests in capital by contrast if roic is less than wacc the company is eroding value and investors should be putting their money elsewhere to fully utilize any stock metric you must know how to read an income statement learn what figures to consider when performing a profitability analysis read find investment quality in the income statement the extent to which roic exceeds wacc provides an extremely powerful tool for choosing investments the p e ratio on the other hand does not tell investors whether the company is producing value or how much capital the company consumes to produce its earnings roic by contrast provides all this valuable information and more moreover roic helps explain why companies trade at different p e ratios the market demonstrates this well from to the s p average p e ratio fell roughly from to so the s p was trading at a discount to its historical multiple does that mean the s p was oversold some market watchers thought so but roic based analysis suggested otherwise although the p e ratio diminished there was also a proportional reduction in the market s roic this makes a lot of sense since companies had had a much harder time allocating capital to worthwhile projects investors should look not only at the level of roic but also the trend a falling roic can provide an early warning sign of a company s difficulty in choosing investment opportunities or coping with competitors roic that is going up meanwhile strongly indicates that a company is pulling ahead of competitors or that its managers are more effectively allocating capital investments the return on capital employed roce is an often overlooked financial ratio but it s one that can accurately calculate corporate efficiency and profitability learn more in spotting profitability with roce the bottom lineroic is a highly reliable instrument for measuring investment quality it takes a bit of work but once
