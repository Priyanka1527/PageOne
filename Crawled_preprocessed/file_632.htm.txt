products like stocks bonds or mutual funds many of the financial ratios used in fundamental analysis include things like outstanding shares and the float let s go through these terms so that next time you come across them you will know their significance restricted and float when you look a little closer at the quotes for a company you may see some obscure terms that you ve never encountered for instance restricted shares refer to a company s issued stock that cannot be bought or sold without special permission by the sec often this type of stock is given to insiders as part of their salaries or as additional benefits another term you may encounter is float this refers to a company s shares that are freely bought and sold without restrictions by the public denoting the greatest proportion of stocks trading on the exchanges the float consists of regular shares that many of us will hear or read about in the news authorized shares authorized shares refer to the largest number of shares that a single corporation can issue the number of authorized shares per company is assessed at the company s creation and can only be increased or decreased through shareholders vote if at the time of incorporation the documents state that shares are authorized then only shares can be issued but just because a company can issue a certain number of shares doesn t mean it will issue all of them to the public typically companies will for many reasons keep a portion of the shares in their own treasury for example company xyz may decide to maintain a controlling interest within the treasury just to ward off any hostile takeover bids on the other hand the company may have shares handy in case it wants to sell them for excess cash rather than borrowing this tendency of a company to reserve some of its authorized shares leads us to the next important and related term outstanding shares outstanding shares not to be confused with authorized shares outstanding shares refer to the number of stocks that a company actually has issued this number represents all the shares that can be bought and sold by the public as well as all the restricted shares that require special permission before being transacted as we already explained shares that can be freely bought and sold by public investors are called the float this value changes depending on whether the company wishes to repurchase shares from the market or sell out more of its authorized shares from within its treasury let s look back at our company xyz from the previous example we know that this company has authorized shares if it offered shares in an ipo gave to the executives and retained in the treasury then the number of shares outstanding would be shares float shares restricted shares if after a couple years xyz was doing extremely well and wanted to buy back shares from the market the number of outstanding shares would fall to the number of treasury shares would increase to and the float would fall to shares since the buyback was done through the market hold on a minute though this is not the only way the number of outstanding shares can fluctuate in addition to the stocks they issue to investors and executives many companies offer stock options and warrants these are instruments that give the holder a right to purchase more stock from the company s treasury every time one of these instruments is activated the float and shares outstanding increase while the number of treasury stocks decrease for example suppose xyz issues warrants if all these warrants are activated then xyz will have to sell shares from its treasury to the warrant holders thus by following the most recent example where the number of outstanding shares is and treasury shares total exercising all the warrants would change the numbers to and respectively and the float would increase to this effect is known as dilution the bottom line because the difference between the number of authorized and outstanding shares can be so large it s important that you realize what they are and which figures the company is using different ratios may use the basic number of outstanding shares while others may use the diluted version this can affect the numbers significantly and possibly change your attitude toward a particular investment furthermore by identifying the number of restricted shares versus the number of shares in the float investors can gauge the level of ownership and autonomy that insiders have within the company all these scenarios are important for investors to understand before they make a decision to buy or
