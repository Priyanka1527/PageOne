choose one and it doesnâ t suit your risk tolerance or schedule you can make a change however be forewarned doing so is expensive every purchase carries a fee more important selling assets creates a realized capital gain these gains are taxable and therefore expensive here we look at four common investing strategies that suit most investors by taking the time to understand the characteristics of each you will be in a better position to choose the one thatâ s right for you over the long term without the need to incur the expense of changing course strategy value investing value investors are bargain shoppers they seek stocks they believe are undervalued they look for stocks with prices they believe donâ t fully reflect the intrinsic value of the security value investing is predicated in part on the idea that some degree of irrationality exists in the market this irrationality in theory presents opportunities to get a stock at a discounted price and make money from that stock itâ s not necessary for value investors to comb through volumes of financial data to find deals thousands of â valueâ mutual funds give investors the chance to own a basket of stocks thought to be undervalued the russell value index for example is a popular benchmark for value investors and several mutual funds mimic this index as discussed above investors can change strategies anytime but doing so especially as a value investor can be costly despite this many investors give up on the strategy after a few poor performing years in for example as wall street journal reporter jason zweig explained â over the decade ended dec value funds specializing in large stocks returned an average of annually but the typical investor in those funds earned just annually â why did this happen because too many decided to cut and run to make value investing work you must play the long game however if you are a true value investor you need no convincing to stay in it for the long game because this strategy is designed around the idea that one should buy businesses not stocks that is the investor must consider the big picture not a temporary knockout performance people often cite legendary investor warren buffet as the epitome of a value investor he does his homework sometimes for years but when heâ s ready he goes all in and he is committed for the long term consider for example buffettâ s words when he made a substantial investment in the airline industry he explained that airlines had a bad first century then he said and they got that century out of the way i hope this thinking exemplifies much of the value investing approach choices are based on decades of trends and with decades of future performance in mind for those who donâ t have time to perform exhaustive research the p e ratio price earnings ratio has become the primary tool for identifying undervalued i e cheap stocks fast this is a single number that comes from dividing a stockâ s share price by its earnings per share a lower p e ratio signifies that youâ re paying less per of current earnings value investors seek companies with a low p e ratio while using the p e ratio is a good start some experts warn this measurement alone is not enough to make the strategy work research published in the financial analysts journal determined that â quantitative investment strategies based on such ratios are not good substitutes for value investing strategies that use a comprehensive approach in identifying underpriced securities â the reason according to their work is that investors are often lured by low p e ratio stocks based on temporarily inflated accounting numbers these low figures are in many instances the result of a falsely high earnings figure the denominator when real earnings are reported not just forecasted theyâ re often lower this results in a â reversion to the mean â the p e ratio goes up and the value the investor pursued is gone if using the p e ratio alone is flawed what should an investor do to find true value stocks the researchers suggest â quantitative approaches to detecting these distortions â such as combining formulaic value with momentum quality and profitability measures â can help in avoiding these â value traps â â the message here is that value investing can work so long as the investor is a in it for the long term and b prepared to apply some serious effort and research to their stock selection those willing to put the work in and stick around stand to gain one study from dodge cox determined that value strategies nearly always outperform growth strategies â over horizons of a decade or more â the study goes on to explain that value strategies have underperformed growth strategies for a year period in just three periods over the last years those periods were the great depression the technology stock bubble and the period strategy growth investing rather than look for low cost deals growth investors want investments that offer strong upside potential when it comes to the stockâ s future earnings it could be said that a growth investor is often looking for the â next big thing â growth investing however is not a reckless embrace of speculative investing rather it involves evaluating a stockâ s current health as well as its potential to grow a growth investor will consider the prospects of the industry in which the stock thrives you may ask for example if thereâ s a future for electric vehicles before investing in tesla or you might ask yourself if a i will become a fixture of everyday living before investing in a technology company there must be evidence of a widespread and robust appetite for the company s services or products if itâ s going to grow investors can get an answer to this question by looking at recent history simply put a growth stock should be growing the company should have a consistent trend of strong earnings and revenue signifying a capacity to deliver on growth expectations a drawback to growth investing is a lack of dividends if a company is in growth mode it often needs capital to sustain its expansion this doesnâ t leave much or any cash left for dividend payments moreover with faster earnings growth comes higher valuations which are for most investors a higher risk proposition does growth investing work as the research above indicates value investing over the long term tends to outperform growth investing these findings donâ t mean that a growth investor cannot profit from the strategy it merely means that a growth strategy doesnâ t usually generate the level of returns seen with value investing however as a study from new york universityâ s stern school of business found â while growth investing underperforms value investing especially over long time periods it is also true that there are sub periods where growth investing dominates â the challenge of course is determining when these â sub periodsâ will occur â interestingly determining the periods when a growth strategy is poised to perform may mean looking at the gross domestic product gdp take the period through when a growth strategy beat a value strategy in seven years and during five of these years the gdp growth rate was below meanwhile a value strategy won in nine years and in seven of those years the gdp was above therefore it stands to reason that a growth strategy may be more successful during periods of decreasing gdp some growth investing style detractors warn that â growth at any priceâ is a dangerous approach such a drive gave rise to the tech bubble which vaporized millions of portfolios however at the moment weâ re in a period where growth is winning â over the past decade the average growth stock has returned vs just for value â according to money magazineâ s investorâ s guide while there is no definitive list of hard metrics to guide a growth strategy there are a few factors an investor should consider research from merrill lynch for example found that growth stocks outperform during periods of falling interest rates however at the first sign of a downturn in the economy growth stocks are often the first to get hit growth investors also need to consider carefully the management prowess of a businessâ s executive team achieving growth is among the most difficult challenges for a firm therefore a stellar leadership team is required investors must watch how the team performs and the means by which it achieves growth growth is of little value if itâ s achieved with heavy borrowing at the same time investors should evaluate the competition a company might be enjoying stellar growth but if its primary product is easily replicated the long term prospects are dim gopro has been a prime example of this phenomenon the once high flying stock has seen regular annual revenue declines since â in the months following its debut shares more than tripled the ipo price of to as much as â the wall street journal reported but in recent months the stock has traded approximately below its ipo price much of this demise is attributed to the easily replicated design after all gopro is at its core a small camera in a box the rising popularity and quality of smartphone cameras offer a cheap alternative to paying for what is essentially a one function piece of equipment moreover the company has been unsuccessful at designing and releasing new products a necessary step to sustaining growth strategy momentum investing momentum investors ride the wave they believe that winners will keep winning and losers will keep losing therefore they look to buy stocks experiencing an uptrend because they believe losers will continue to drop they may choose to short sell those securities however short selling is an exceedingly risky practice more on that later momentum investors could be thought of as â technical analysts â this means they use a strictly data driven approach to trading and look for patterns in stock prices to guide their purchasing decisions therefore momentum investors are acting in defiance of the efficient market hypothesis this hypothesis states that asset prices fully reflect all information available to the public itâ s difficult to believe this statement and be a momentum investor given that the strategy seeks to capitalize on undervalued and overvalued equities does it work as is the case with so many other investing styles the answer is complicated letâ s take a closer look rob arnott chairman and founder of research affiliates researched this question his finding â no u s mutual fund with â momentumâ in its name has since its inception outperformed their benchmark net of fees and expenses â interestingly arnottâ s research also showed that simulated portfolios that put a theoretical momentum investing strategy to work actually â add remarkable value in most time periods and in most asset classes â however when used in a real world scenario results are poor why in two words trading costs all of that buying and selling stirs up a lot of brokerage and commission fees traders adhering to a momentum strategy need to be at the switch and ready to buy and sell at all times profits build over months not years this is in contrast to simple buy and hold strategies that take a â set it and forget itâ approach for those who take lunch breaks or simply donâ t have an interest in watching the market every day there are momentum style etfs exchange traded funds these shares give an investor access to a basket of stocks deemed to be characteristic of momentum securities despite some of its shortcomings momentum investing has its appeal consider for example that â the msci world momentum index has averaged annual gains of over the past two decades almost twice that of the broader benchmark â however this return probably doesnâ t account for trading costs and the time required for execution recent research has found that it may be possible to actively trade a momentum strategy without the need for full time trading and research using u s data from the new york stock exchange between and a study found that a simplified momentum strategy outperformed the benchmark even after accounting for transaction costs moreover a minimum investment of was enough to realize the benefits the same research found that comparing this basic strategy to one of more frequent smaller trades showed the latter outperformed it but only to a degree sooner or later the trading costs of a rapid fire approach eroded the returns better still the researchers determined that â the optimal momentum trading frequency ranges from bi yearly to monthly â a surprisingly reasonable pace as mentioned earlier aggressive momentum traders may also use short selling as a means of boosting returns this technique allows an investor to profit from a drop in an assetâ s price the short seller believing a security will fall in price borrows shares totaling for example â next the short seller immediately sells those shares on the market for and then waits for the asset to drop when it does they repurchase the shares so they can be returned to the lender at letâ s say therefore the short seller gained on the initial sale then spent to get the shares back for a gain of the problem with this strategy is that there is unlimited downside risk in normal investing the downside risk is the total value of your investment if you invest the most you can lose is however with short selling your maximum possible loss is limitless in the scenario above for example you borrow shares and sell them for but perhaps the stock doesnâ t drop as expected instead it goes up the shares are worth then and so on sooner or later the short seller must repurchase the shares to return them to the lender if the share price keeps increasing this will be an expensive proposition in sum a momentum strategy may be profitable but not if it comes at the limitless downside risk associated with short selling strategy dollar cost averaging dollar cost averaging dca or the practice of making regular investments in the market over time is not mutually exclusive to the other methods described above rather it is a means of executing whatever strategy you chose with dca you might choose to put in an investment account every month for example this disciplined approach becomes particularly powerful when you use automated features that invest for you itâ s easy to commit to a plan when the process requires almost no oversight the benefit of dca is that it avoids the painful and ill fated strategy of market timing even seasoned investors occasionally feel the temptation to buy when they think prices are low only to discover to their dismay that they have a longer way to drop when investments happen in regular increments the investor is capturing prices at all levels from high to low these periodic investments effectively lower the average per share cost of the purchases putting dca to work means deciding on three parameters the total sum to be invested the window of time during which the investments will be made and finally the frequency of purchases dollar cost averaging is a wise choice for most investors it keeps you committed to savings while reducing risk and the effects of volatility however for those in the position to invest a lump sum dca may not be the best approach according to a vanguard study â on average we find that an lsi lump sum investment approach has outperformed a dca approach approximately two thirds of the time even when results are adjusted for the higher volatility of a stock bond portfolio versus cash investments â however most investors are not in a position to make a single large investment therefore dca is appropriate for most moreover a dca approach is an effective countermeasure to the cognitive bias inherent to humans new investors and experienced ones alike are susceptible to hard wired flaws in judgment â loss aversion bias â for example causes us to view the gain or loss of an amount of money asymmetrically additionally â confirmation biasâ leads us to focus on and remember information that confirms our long held beliefs while ignoring contradictory information that may be important dollar cost averaging circumvents these common problems by removing human frailties from the equation regular automated investments prevent spontaneous illogical behavior the same vanguard study even concluded â if the investor is primarily concerned with minimizing downside risk and potential feelings of regret resulting from lump sum investing immediately before a market downturn then dca may be of use â ready to put these strategies into play first check out investopedia s broker reviews the bottom line more important than the strategy itself is the decision to choose a strategy indeed any of these strategies can generate a significant return as long as the investor makes a choice and commits to it the reason it is important to choose is that the sooner you start the greater the effects of compounding remember donâ t focus exclusively on annual returns when choosing a strategy engage the approach that suits your schedule and risk tolerance the reason ignoring these aspects can lead to a high abandon rate and frequently changed strategies and as discussed above numerous changes generate costs that eat away at your annual rate of return latest news vanguard where you move in retirement more a lifestyle than investment choice freddie mac
