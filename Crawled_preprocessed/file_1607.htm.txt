and mortar bank for an online checking account has several pros and cons the pros include higher yields lower fees and high tech features that help with account maintenance and budgeting the cons include more difficult access to customer service as well as online security concerns online banks have less overhead than their brick and mortar counterparts and most pass those savings to their clients in the form of higher yields and lower fees as of february the u s average annual percentage yield apy for checking accounts is under however during the same month several online banks are offering checking accounts with apys of or higher another big draw for online checking is its low fees also a result of overhead savings being passed on to the consumer because online banks typically do not maintain dedicated atms many reimburse their customers for the charges they incur making out of network withdrawals high tech features such as budgeting assistance and compatibility with personal finance software such as quicken and microsoft money are another big draw to online checking accounts many of which enable you to set up automatic weekly or monthly transfers of a set amount of money to or from other accounts this service can help you stick to a monthly budget or build your savings another popular feature is the automatic downloading of account information to personal finance software which also helps with budgeting and can make filing your taxes much less arduous before signing up to make the switch understand that online checking accounts come with a few drawbacks including not having access to face to face customer service sitting down with a personal banker at your local branch can make it easier to deal with any issues that arise with your account

their customer service to normal business hours online security is another concern few things are more sacred than your banking information and few things can cause you more trouble if it falls into the hands of an unscrupulous person though most online banks provide encryption software and high tech site security cyber criminals have used malware to infect online banking customers browsers and
