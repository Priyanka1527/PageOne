article helpful share far too often our initial consultations with clients reveal that they are lacking adequate asset protection from mistakes as simple as carrying too little car insurance to more complex ones like not utilizing asset protection trusts safeguarding your assets is a vital part of optimal wealth management while many people think that asset protection is only for the extremely wealthy this is simply not the case in fact if you have a household income above and you have a net worth of excluding your k assets but including the equity in your home it s time for you to consider protecting your assets intelligently prudent asset protection creates a series of layers for creditors to go through so that if you do get sued creditors are most likely going to settle for an amount that is covered by insurance instead of chasing after your personal assets for more see the importance of life insurance for lost income where to begin an asset protection plan begins with the state you live in since each state has its own laws with regards to what is protected for example florida and texas both have homestead laws that exclude your primary residence from a lawsuit from there federal law provides some protection for qualified retirement assets like k s beyond that it s generally up to you to place the remaining layers to protect your assets in this article we are going to focus on the first two layers auto insurance and umbrella insurance most people have the proper amount of home insurance so we will leave that out of our discussion let s start with the first auto insurance first layer auto insurance for most people outside of highly litigious professions auto accidents are the most threatening events to accumulated wealth a lawsuit resulting from an auto accident can quickly send creditors chasing after your money so how can you protect yourself carry the proper amount of bodily injury and uninsured motorist insurance how much enough to cover your non federal and non state protected assets such as your home or k in some cases as mentioned above for example if you live in florida and have taxable accounts worth and a salary of you have of assets that need protecting in order to provide protection you would need to purchase a to bodily injury policy if you have unprotected assets north of a to bodily injury policy is needed as a best practice set your uninsured motorist limits equal to your bodily injury limits what does it cost stepping up your protection from a to policy to a to policy generally results in only an increase in annual premiums for more see financial planning decisions you won t regret what if i have more than in unprotected assets then auto insurance won t adequately protect you because it caps out at of protection but don t worry this is where the second layer of protection umbrella insurance comes in second layer umbrella insurance umbrella insurance is simply additional coverage above any regular home auto motorcycle and boat insurance coverage it is named umbrella because it sits on top of your other insurances and covers liability claims from all the policies underneath it how does it work umbrella insurance will pay for medical court or other expenses that may be required after your basic home auto and boat policies stop coverage levels start at million and can run beyond million depending on your needs how much do i need generally speaking you will need enough insurance to cover all of your unprotected assets for example if you live in texas and have a million home a million k and of unprotected assets a million dollar umbrella insurance policy will be adequate the home is covered under texas homestead exemption and the k is protected by the federal government note most k s are offered full protection but sole proprietor k protection varies state by state what does it cost it s very affordable you can generally obtain million of umbrella coverage for as little as annually in premiums the bottom line carrying the proper levels of auto insurance and umbrella insurance will keep your assets properly protected which will reduce your worries and lead to greater peace of mind
