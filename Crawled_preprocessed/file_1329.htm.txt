february of people found this article helpful share finally investment management fees are being considered more widely the popular media government regulators and informed consumers are realizing just how important the cost of fees associated with investing is to investment success investment management fees are complex and there is not much effort to educate investors so they remain insidious

which are usually a percentage of the assets under management aum for nonprofits the typical competitive bid situation compares this cost between various vendors portfolio manager fees are less obvious the second layer of fees is less obvious these are third party portfolio fees and they are a component of mutual funds hedge funds exchange traded funds etfs unit trusts reits and other managed products morningstar offers in depth coverage of these fee ratios and costs if your portfolio features separate managed accounts individual stocks or bonds managed by a third party those

averages instead of individual stocks and bonds and the cumulative effect of layered fees directly impacts portfolio returns there have been many instances where layered fees inflicted a crushing blow
