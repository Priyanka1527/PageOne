helpful share when someone says the stock market often the images that come to mind are screaming traders in blue jackets or a large mahogany desk perched atop the glass and steel of wall street s skyscrapers while everyone has a different image of the stock market when gauging how well the market is doing most investors think of the same two market indexes dow jones and s p the dow jones index and the s p index are the ones constantly put in front of us via the news radio and investment statements why dow jones and s p indexes are not good benchmarks the dow jones and s p indexes serve as benchmarks used to grade our portfolios and our financial advisors performance it is human nature for us to want to know how well we are doing in any given task including investing the problem with using these two popular indexes as the comparison is that investors are often much more diversified and conservative then these two classic benchmarks using the common two indexes as a benchmark can be problematic since each one of them has a fairly limited focus the dow jones encompasses only of the largest u s companies and the s p contains large u s companies in contrast many investors often have other asset classes inside their portfolio such as bonds international stocks small stocks and hard assets as investors add more and more asset classes to their portfolio they are attempting to broaden their diversification when diversification is added correctly investors will experience less correlation with the market and ideally less volatility investors should be conscious of the fact that a diversified portfolio will not mirror the market and they should not want it to either by adding diversification investors can often experience better long term performance with less volatility for related reading see the importance of diversification it is pretty clear that the dow and s p are not good benchmarks for diversified portfolios however what can be lost in that logic is how using those indexes as benchmarks can negatively influence investors via basic behavioral finance tendencies when investors eagerly watch the indexes certain tendencies can be created such as short term unrealistic return expectations in up markets and increased panic during down markets the emotions caused by these unrealistic return expectations and panic from down markets can lead to poor investment decisions driven by fear or greed warren buffet was once quoted as saying be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful despite mr buffet s common sense investing tip study after study has supported his view that retail investors make poor decisions and as a result drastically underperform the indexes for related reading see the financial markets when fear and greed take over use a blended benchmark from a financial advisor recently vanguard produced a white paper titled putting a value on your value quantifying vanguard advisor s alpha in it they detailed how much value an investor can really get from using a professional financial advisor in the study vanguard concluded that simple behavioral finance coaching by a financial advisor can add as much as a year to returns vs the average investor furthermore vanguard concluded that up to a year of value could be added by employing a financial advisor as an alternative to watching the indexes investors should ask their financial advisor for a blended benchmark a blended benchmark combines multiple indexes from different asset classes and then weighs those benchmarks to match the asset allocation of your portfolio a blended benchmark will give you a better idea of how well your portfolio is doing compared to the broad market as opposed to one asset class in one country by watching a blended benchmark that is similar to your blended portfolio investors should be less inclined to invest aggressively when the major indexes are out performing or run and hide when they fall from the record highs they have been flirting with as of late a strategy involving diversification does not ensure a profit and does not protect against a loss in declining markets past performance is no guarantee of future returns the dow jones industrial index and the standard and poor s index are considered to be representative of the larger u s stock market it is not possible to invest directly in an index
