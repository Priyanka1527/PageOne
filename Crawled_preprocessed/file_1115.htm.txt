have a platform to support mutual funds or fixed income securities search function the search function does not retrieve particularly relevant results it will include and highlight all terms in menus and other landing page features for complex search terms founded millionequity sharestraded per day routing options products fees lightspeed s focus on active traders means its commissions and fees must be competitive while basic webtrader accounts are subject to a monthly minimum commission lightspeed platforms are aimed at traders who will easily surpass that threshold basic commissions are some of the lowest in the industry but very active traders can capitalize on even bigger discounts for stocks options etfs and futures contracts to qualify for per share commissions users must qualify as active traders by placing at least trades per month however per share equities pricing is only available on paid platforms not on the free web or mobile platforms lightspeed s margin rates are

the risk of uncovered derivatives trading margin trading and day trading millionexcess sipc bond coveragelloyds of london policy for up to million cash and securities insurance per customer millionadditional coveragecarried by wedbush on behalf of lightspeed at no charge what you need to knowlightspeed takes online security seriously the site uses strong encryption technology and offers two factor authentication on user accounts however lightspeed does share some of your personal information with service providers or companies with which it has mutual marketing agreements it does not sell user information to third party marketing companies with which it doesn t have agreements but users should pay attention to the various opt out options to ensure that their information is shared with as few entities as possible special features this is where lightspeed really shines depending on which platform you use lightspeed provides suites of special features tailored to any trading strategy or technical research need in platform tools studies screeners and testing capabilities make lightspeed an active trader s dream coupled with a wide range of web based resources lightspeed is an ideal broker for aspiring day traders and professional investors alike backtestingtest trading strategies through its partnership with trade ideas specialized trading software and trading platforms customizable routing destinationsroute orders through market centers ecns and dark pools what you need to knowtraders looking for all the bells and whistles should look no further lightspeed has consistently improved and expanded its suite of advanced tools and features highlighting its focus on professional grade and institutional investors lightspeed s partnership with trade ideas offers users an even wider array of fully customizable and automated trading and strategy testing options and it consistently receives accolades and awards from industry insiders however lightspeed does not offer advisory services human or robo so it isn t ideal for anyone looking for professional assistance desktop experience lightspeed s basic web based platform is easily customizable and offers plenty of tools and research resources for active traders who want a solid free platform the a month advanced lightspeed trader desktop platform however is built for the trader who needs one screen access to multiple data sources each quote profile news stream or trading screen is its own window which can be arranged to suit the trader s needs you can keep a few crucial quotes open at the top of your screen as you go about other business or fill your monitor with data while the flexibility of these platforms is fantastic for day traders and professionals it may be unnecessarily robust for the buy and hold crowd proslightspeed offers fully customizable charts even for the basic webtrader platform your customized settings and layouts are stored on lightspeed s server so you can access saved settings from any device in addition to offering a wide range of technical studies the webtrader platform allows users to overlay drawn trend lines and free form diagrams as well as fibonacci circles error channels and raff regressions for non professionals lightspeed streams real time market data across all platforms for professional investors using the free webtrader platform real time data and research comes at a per month premium but it is included with all advanced platforms the advanced lightspeed trader platform offers a huge array of tools and resources and is relatively easy to use after an initial learning curve tickers can be added to watchlists based on currently open quotes and analyst ratings news and other research tools automatically update when you pull up a quote for a new ticker symbol for options traders advanced options data chains and analysis are available on the free livevol x platform for futures traders there are multiple options including the free cme direct platform consunsurprisingly the primary downsides of lightspeed s desktop experience revolve around the difference between the free and paid platforms for example all paid platforms allow for conditional orders but the free platform does not for new or casual investors or those who are not interested in day trading the primary drawback of the lightspeed platforms is that they may be overwhelming the advanced platform especially is very data heavy with real time streaming updates in multiple windows and numerous ways to customize and adjust each screen an investor looking to simply research and trade a handful of securities a year would be better served by a leaner platform mobile experience lightspeed offers both a mobile website and downloadable apps for ios and android while these mobile options aren t quite as robust as the web based or downloadable desktop platforms they are still serviceable for checking stock prices news and watchlist alerts on the go prosboth the mobile site and the app allow users to create and update watchlists and alert settings read relevant news and place equity and options trades from anywhere you can view activity charts within the quote screen and switch quickly from news and stock info to options chains with a single tap while the apps have slightly limited capabilities the mobile site is the same as the standard web based platform meaning you can access screeners and see your dynamically updated order info on the go consthe primary downside of lightspeed s mobile offerings is their lack of analytical tools charting capabilities are minimal and you can t overlay studies or draw trend lines the absence of screening tools analyst research and other advanced resources makes the apps better suited for investment monitoring than execution customer support since lightspeed is an online brokerage focused on active traders it puts a heavy emphasis on speedy support while phone lines are staffed only during market hours traders who call in for help then will be in touch with a professional in seconds or less for day traders that quick response time can make a world of difference while phone support is fast and efficient lightspeed doesn t offer online chat or hour assistance once again lightspeed s focus is on active traders who already know what they re doing not on new investors or those who like to have someone walk them through new features the exception to this rule is for traders using one of the futures trading platforms they do have access to hour support email what you need to knowfor day traders immediate phone assistance is available during market hours both email and an internal messaging system are available for less time sensitive queries lightspeed also has both facebook and twitter accounts which are regularly monitored while it isn t the primary method of support questions sent in on social media are attended to in a timely manner research insights like its special features lightspeed s selection of active trading focused research tools analyst ratings and technical data make this broker ideal for analysis junkies the site s resources section provides product tutorials general news educational resources and a blog active trading however neither the site the free webtrader platform nor the advanced lightspeed trader platform offers any fundamental analysis resources analyst ratingsrobust selection of analyst ratings and reports as well as accountability metrics through partnership with tiprankspeer to peer forumin partnership with hammerstone markets view current news trade ideas and compare strategies with other traders active trader bloginsight on strategy analysis alternative investments such as cryptocurrencies and margin tradingweekly index updatesnews and blog sections provide weekly updates of ipox index performancewatchlists and alertseasily customizable watchlists and alerts allow you to keep track of numerous securities at oncestock screeneradvanced platforms include customizable stock screeners to help you identify opportunities proslightspeed is all about technical analysis the charting capabilities of its platforms ensure that traders can find view overlay and analyze any performance metric their hearts desire the stock screeners and in depth analyst reports help users pinpoint opportunities while the customizable watchlists and alerts keep them abreast of crucial developments the active trading blog is full of contributor content aimed at helping users learn and execute short term trade strategies and make the most of everything the platforms have to offer the livevol x options trading platform provides more advanced options data and analysis and all users have access to the tipranks suite of resources consunfortunately lightspeed s laser like focus on active trading means it has no room in its feature suite for fundamental analysis there is no way to check company financials review ratios track earnings or otherwise take stock of how a given company is doing this makes sense of course because lightspeed is built for people who trade minute to minute not year to year so long term corporate trends and future innovations are less important than being able to chart multiple studies or keep a handful of quotes on screen at once however investors who want to incorporate fundamentals into their trading strategy will be best served elsewhere in addition lightspeed s website is light on any actual news instead focusing on brokerage mentions in industry publications the free web based platform does offer real time news as part of the streaming data package free for non professional users and the paid downloadable platforms include streaming data and news in the monthly fee unfortunately you cannot sort news by market or index making it harder to locate market or sector specific updates education though lightspeed s focus is on traders who are already fairly advanced the site still provides a surprisingly rich array of educational resources the education section has numerous videos articles and webinars aimed at teaching new traders the basics of different securities explaining important tax considerations and outlining trading strategies the site also provides a number of online classes and faqs to help new and still learning investors find what they need to progress glossaryfocused active trading strategies and technical analysisproduct tutorialsshort videos walk users through different platforms and subsequent software updatesvideosbrush up on topics from tax issues to day trading tips and tricks what you need to knowwhile lightspeed may not be the ideal platform for new or casual traders its website provides a decent selection of useful educational resources even if you aren t looking to become an active trader the education section is a good place to look for information especially if you re interested in learning about more advanced options trading lightspeed provides truly in depth overviews of more than strategies including maximum gains and losses the role of time decay and the impact of market volatility banking lightspeed is not a brokerage looking to dominate the entirety of the investment industry it is focused on providing cutting edge investment platforms for very active traders it doesn t deviate from its core offering by providing banking services bottom line lightspeed was built to fill a niche in the investment industry and it hasn t shifted focus since its founding in this platform won t be suitable for new investors those looking for managed portfolio or advisory services or even diy investors planning to execute only a handful of trades a year but for day traders data junkies or even professional investment managers lightspeed s advanced platforms offer cutting edge features research tools and charting capabilities the mobile offerings aren t built for meaningful trading activity but the desktop platforms allow for a degree of analysis customization and automation that would be difficult to top reviewed by claire boyte white january claire has been writing about retirement
