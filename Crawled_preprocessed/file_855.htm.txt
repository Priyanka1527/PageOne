quality vanguard review by claire boyte white january vanguard s online brokerage specializes in mutual fund money market and etf investments with a focus on investing for retirement open an account overall rating products fees trust special features desktop experience mobile experience customer support research insights education banking return to broker center products fees trust special features desktop experience mobile experience customer support research insights education banking vanguard fast facts founded in vanguard was established on the idea that a mutual fund should be owned by its investors vanguard hasn t shifted its focus much in the decades since its inception while the company now offers an online platform that allows clients to buy and sell a greater variety of securities including stocks and options its primary services still emphasize long term passive investments like mutual funds and etfs vanguard scores a out of from investopedia due primarily to its bare bones trading platform and singular focus on retirement investing this middle of the road rating reflects the fact that the usefulness of vanguard s platform will depend on the investor s goals it s not for the day trader the charting guru or the data junkie however for people looking to invest in solid low cost mutual funds and etfs or those with larger sums who d like an advisor to do the legwork vanguard may be a perfect fit pros no fee for account opening there are never fees to sign up for an account free trades the more money you invest with vanguard the lower your commission rates tiered benefits sterling trader additional fee applies and metatrader waived annual fee the annual fee for brokerage and mutual fund accounts with balances below will be waived if you sign up for document e delivery cons high brokerage fees trading commissions for non vanguard securities are some of the highest in the industry limited choice of securities trading of futures commodities and foreign currency is not available minimal platform capabilities technical indicators available for charting are limited and don t include volume data trendline or other drawing tools delayed quotes ticker profiles and trade screens provide real time data but must be manually refreshed quote level data are delayed at least minutes minimal platform options vanguard offers only its web based trading platform and an even more minimal platform via its mobile apps no chart customization chart configurations cannot be saved for later use no ability to customize anything about the chart setup color fonts size or external add ons sluggish performance the site and trading platform both lack the agility that a more advanced trader would expect circular site site navigation is difficult and the search function leaves much to be desired millionnumber of investorsin countries u s fundsnumber of fundsand international funds trilliontotal aum assets under management products fees vanguard is known for its affordable investment products and many of its mutual funds and etfs have expense ratios far below the industry average that commitment to affordable investing however doesn t always extend to its brokerage fees while vanguard does offer commission free trading for its own mutual funds and etfs as well as for some fixed income securities the standard commissions for other trades are among the highest for active traders who are looking at more than vanguard products and who don t have the million necessary to secure the free trades that come with flagship level accounts vanguard s commission fees can significantly diminish returns vanguard s focus on affluent investors who don t trade regularly is made clear by its fee structure in fact standard level clients actually pay more per trade after the first vanguard s margin rates by contrast are almost a whole point lower than the industry average the vanguard total stock market index fund is vanguard s largest index fund embodying founder john bogle s core philosophy the fund gives you exposure to the entire u s stock market with broad diversification among large mid and small cap companies on both sides of the growth and value spectrum it s a passively managed fund so its expenses are as low as they come at because of its portfolio turnover it is very tax efficient so it is a great fund for taxable accounts bogle was among the first industry leaders to make a direct link between investment expenses and investment performance he was also among the first to point out that the vast majority of actively managed funds cannot beat the market indexes with any degree of consistency if you are a passive investor you can t achieve broader portfolio diversification anywhere else stocks etfs trade options per contract vanguard mutual funds free other mutual funds no load us treasury securities free futures not available forex not available trust the vanguard brand is one of the most trusted and recognizable names in the industry and what it may lack in platform agility it makes up for in security in addition to being a member of both finra and sipc vanguard is a member of the national business coalition on e commerce and privacy under the sipc coverage vanguard customers are protected for up to including for cash claims in accordance with the sec customer protection rule vanguard also has additional coverage through lloyd s of london and london company insurers milliontotal aggregate insurance limit milliontotal cash sub limit millionsecurities limit what you need to knowin addition to vanguard s insurance protection every client is protected against fraud there are several security features available on any account including the option to require two factor authentication when logging on users can elect to use a security key receive individual time sensitive security codes answer security questions or all three clients who prefer to call in to speak with an advisor or representative can also sign up for vanguard voice verification which allows vanguard s phone system to recognize a specified passphrase in the user s unique voice vanguard also uses tls and encryption technology to keep customer data safe and secure on site and promises never to sell customer information to third parties if despite all these security features you are still the victim of fraud vanguard will reimburse any funds taken from your account in an unauthorized transaction provided you ve taken reasonable steps to protect your account and information special features while vanguard may pull out all the stops when it comes to security its falls pretty short in terms of features a few notable absences include the inability to automate trading using predefined and customized rules or logarithms or choose how your orders are routed in addition vanguard offers no advanced platform for more educated or active traders once again vanguard s product is not intended for the diy day trader who wants all the bells and whistles it is aimed largely at investors who prefer to have an advisor robo or otherwise take care of the heavy lifting but who occasionally want to check in on how a given stock or fund is doing without really diving into the data there are however a few useful features that vanguard does offer managed portfoliospersonal advisor for annual fee on invested assets human robo advisorsmonitor your portfolio offers an initial consultation and strategy session with a live human advisor what you need to knowwhere vanguard shines is in its managed investment offerings either through all in one funds that allow investors to choose one product that takes care of the rebalancing itself or through the personal advisor service vanguard is focused on clients who lack either the time or the interest to be actively involved in their investments the site is light on special features but heavy on retirement focused content and services vanguard knows its key demographic and isn t wasting money or time trying to compete with more agile platforms for a piece of the active investor pie while it does offer some actively managed funds and its advisor services are tailored to the needs of each individual investor passive long term investing is the name of the game at vanguard and its platform s offerings reflect that desktop experience because of its lack of special features vanguard s trading platform may leave something to be desired unlike its competitors vanguard doesn t offer any downloadable desktop platforms or tools for more advanced traders its web based platform is the most advanced product available its mobile platform is serviceable but not inspiring an active trader will find this platform spare and slow while the platform does allow you to buy and sell more than just mutual funds and etfs the minimal charting capabilities lack of support for advanced trading strategies and paltry selection of deep dive research materials makes it clear that vanguard s heart just isn t in active trading prosvanguard s web based platform does allow you to create up to six customized watchlists and you can receive customized alerts via email or text the charting features let you compare multiple ticker symbols and indices you can also place trades after the market closes between the hours of p m and p m est for no additional fees in general the web based platform performs the basic functions of any trading platform you can search for ticker symbols pull up quotes look at price history read financial statements and market reports and check in on relevant news and research consstock price information isn t always real time and quote pages must be refreshed to get new prices charting capabilities are limited with only nine technical indicators available and no way to plot more than one at a time charting is not robust you can t save a chart layout or customize anything other than the chart type candle mountain line ohlc trading volume isn t shown you can add smas emas and bollinger bands as well as plot dividends splits and earnings reports but that s the extent of the platform s indicator selection there s no option for simulated trading vanguard s platform also doesn t offer any kind of trading journal you can view your past transactions under your account but there is no way to make notes save screen shots or otherwise document personal or market conditions for later study in order to place a trade you may be required to execute a series of steps just to access the trade screen there are a number of ways to get there but entering through the investing tab at the top of screen and clicking through a few additional links can result in an involuntary log off see platform walkthrough mobile experience vanguard offers mobile apps for ios android and kindle fire as well as having a mobile website while the app would not be the ideal tool for entering new positions or liquidating current ones it is absolutely serviceable in terms of checking on investment progress verifying executed trades viewing stock prices and other general housekeeping it is relatively user friendly and even a little bit quicker than the web based platform prosgetting to the trading screen is actually much easier in the app than on the site where it can take three steps or more and quotes in the trading screen are real time you can also access news and research and narrow the results by topic though not by keyword the app has a good range of security features including fingerprint verification you can also deposit checks either made out to you or to vanguard directly to your account using your phone s camera which is a great feature the app and mobile site both allow for customized alerts and watchlists and the mobile site provides all the same charting capabilities as the desktop version conswhile the mobile site technically has all the same capabilities as the desktop version accessing them can be difficult if you want to use stock screeners or other tools the in app mobile site will open another window in your mobile device s browser and it may or may not load the page you re looking for you may need to log in again in the new window you ll also need to log back into the app if you want to use it again since you ve left the in app mobile site transitioning from app to in app site and then back to app can result in involuntary log off despite the little pop up message saying you will remain logged on while on the site see platform walkthrough customer support the vanguard site provides a number of resources for account navigation and tech support including how to guides and a searchable faq section vanguard also offers multiple ways to get in touch if you can t find the information you need online including by phone mail or through a secure message center while there are dedicated phone numbers for different inquiry types vanguard only offers limited support and it does not offer an online chat tdd tty dedicated phone lines are available but require an unnecessary amount of energy to locate twitter what you need to knowthe secure message center can be accessed only by existing clients and there is no online chat available for either existing or prospective clients while phone lines are staffed only from a m to p m monday through friday eastern time existing clients have access to automated assistance though the phone number is only visible on the contact page once you log out research insights vanguard s site provides all of the standard research and information resources you would expect of any online broker while it s easy to find data on stock price history company financials dividend payouts and market news there isn t much in the way of data synthesis or education which will be discussed later still the site does offer a wide range of data resources analyst ratingsanalyst reports from both argus and marketgraderfixed income trade deskdedicated online trading platform for bonds and other fixed income securitiesmutual fund and etf screenercustomizable screener allows you to search for funds etfs or bothfundamentalsbalance sheets income statements and cash flow documents over four quartersstock screenerscreen for value large and small cap stocks or customize a screener with a wide range of optionsglobal domestic marketsnews and perspectives on the u s and other global markets prosif you re looking to invest in mutual funds etfs or fixed income securities vanguard s research tools should serve you well all the screeners are relatively robust even the stock screener which makes them valuable tools for traders who know what they re looking for the ticker profiles provide a good cross section of data on company financials market and sector news and analyst ratings conswhile vanguard s research tools can be useful they aren t always easy to find the stock screener can be accessed easily once you are on a ticker profile page which itself requires a search and click but it s difficult to find otherwise in general all screeners require that you click through a series of informational pages burying them sometimes three or four layers deep entering the term screener in the search bar or even specifying a particular screener still doesn t result in a direct link instead you must choose the information page finding individual stocks and bonds scroll to the bottom and click use our stock screener if you d like to access the mutual fund screener or the fixed income trade desk you must select use our tools to search for investments and then choose the relevant screener from the new page if you know exactly what you re looking for and how to find it the search function is somewhat helpful otherwise it s often quicker just to enter the relevant search terms and the word vanguard into your browser s search engine and let it take you where you want to go education the river of vanguard s educational offerings is narrow but deep if you re looking at mutual funds or etfs vanguard provides a wide range of products news and opinion on the pros and cons of different types of funds if you re trying to decide between funds and etfs there s a similarly broad range of educational resources that explain how each product works what it costs and what kind of investor it might be best for you ll also find solid retirement investing advice and information about college savings plans on both the main site and blog but educational resources on other aspects of investing such as how to use and interpret technical indicators financial statements and charting data are sorely lacking once again vanguard s major focus on retirement investors and those who will enlist its advisor services means that the site doesn t cater to more active traders or even to new traders wanting to learn more about stocks options or analysis etf educationheavy focus on etfseducational and opinion based resourcesmutual fund educationthe basics of mutual fundslearn which funds may be right for youvideosnews perspectivesvideos on numerous topics what you need to knowthere s a decent amount of information on the vanguard site but again those useful resources aren t always easy to access and the search function is not particularly helpful for example vanguard does allow investors to purchase ipo shares but a search for ipo or initial public offering brings up nothing that is immediately relevant you have to click on the stock trading basic information page to learn anything about the topic other securities that vanguard doesn t support or features the site doesn t offer don t come up in search results at all for example the term forex fails to retrieve any relevant results similarly the platform does allow rsi charting but neither rsi nor relative strength index or even relative strength indicator as it s called on the platform retrieve relevant search results what s more none of these terms is included in the glossary banking vanguard is an investment company not a bank as such it doesn t offer typical banking products such as standard checking or savings accounts that said it does provide some services that are similar to a bank for clients with voyager select and flagship level accounts vanguardadvantage r check writing and debit card only available to clients with or more in total assets ira check writing minimum per check account holders must be or older money market fundlow risk accounts can serve as savings accounts what you need to knowvanguard s focus isn t on banking or on trying to dominate markets outside of its core demographic it doesn t offer any kind of free banking services as many competitors do nor does it provide mortgage or other loan services its core offerings are mutual funds and etfs along with advisory services and it doesn t try to entice additional customers through credit card offers or other flashy products vanguard knows what it does well and sticks to that bottom line vanguard is one of the oldest names in the online brokerage industry and it has earned its spot among the most trusted brands through consistency this isn t the platform for fledgling traders looking to learn about how to read a chart or what the numbers on a financial statement actually mean there are other platforms available that have a far more comprehensive array of features and services instead vanguard is for the classic long term passive investor whose focus is on building up retirement savings with little to no daily interaction its advisory services are well regarded and its range of affordable mutual funds and etfs is second to none for people who want to put their money in a managed portfolio or attain automatic diversification through fund or etf investment and especially for those with a lot of money to invest who want professional guidance vanguard provides trusted products consistent performance and superior security for people who like to be more actively involved with their investments or want to really dive into the data other platforms are a better choice reviewed by claire
