the back of bold economic promises to cut personal and corporate taxes restructure trade deals and introduce large fiscal stimulus measures focused on infrastructure and defense next up federal income tax tax rate trumpflation income tax breaking down trumponomics skip to a section economic forecasts growth inflation and interest rates jobs after tax earnings trade national debt economic policies trade immigration taxes national debt infrastructure energy healthcare monetary policy regulation budget market reactions skip to top trump was not always clear and consistent about his policies and when he was they were often unorthodox enough to have unpredictable consequences this resulting uncertainty helps explain the market reaction to his win in the early morning of november dow jones industrial average futures plunged to a low points below their previous close and trading in s p and nasdaq futures fell fast enough to trip circuit breakers the mexican peso which had become a proxy for trump s chances of success went into free fall treasury yields dropped by nearly basis points as investors piled into the safe haven then a funny thing happened except in the case of the peso which continued to slump against the dollar these initial reactions reversed themselves treasury yields stopped falling and promptly gained around basis points as bearishness on government bonds took over the dow closed up nearly points futures closed up for a point reversal the next day the index closed at a record the following three sessions also saw record closes and at the open on january the dow broke for the first time economic forecasts skip to top trump rewrote his tax plan twice he had it both ways when it came to the fed s low interest rate policy a lack of consistency coupled with an oratorical style that often leaves room for multiple interpretations has made putting numbers on trumponomics challenging yet on a few points trump was perfectly clear he wanted to put curbs on immigration and trade lower taxes on individuals and businesses and increase spending on infrastructure projects using these and other tangible promises economists hazarded guesses during the campaign about the effect trump is likely to have on economic growth the labor market and the national debt unsurprisingly these predictions vary widely growth skip to top during the third televised debate trump said of gross domestic product gdp growth we re bringing it from up to and i actually think we can go higher than i think you can go to or treasury secretary steve mnuchin is less gung ho telling congress on february and fox news three days later that the administration s target is or higher a few months earlier in june a team led by moody s chief economist mark zandi had forecast that if trump were to implement his policies at face value real gdp would expand by about annually from to that rate is considerably slower than moody s baseline estimate of assuming trump has to backtrack on some of his policies due to a hostile congress moody s projects annual growth the tax foundation is more sanguine about trumponomics prospects the right leaning think tank projected in september that his policies would increase gdp by to over the long term they did not give an exact time frame in addition to the baseline growth the congressional budget office cbo forecast in august for the oecd is also optimistic in its november economic outlook it projected that trump s fiscal stimulus will boost u s gdp growth in by percentage points ppt from its baseline estimate to in growth is projected to receive a ppt bump to the oecd expects this added growth to spill over into other economies pushing global gdp growth up by ppt to in and by ppt to the following year the forecasts assume however that trump s rhetoric on trade does not result in protectionist policies see trade below jobs skip to top the peterson institute for international economics piie wrote in september that it expects trump s policies if implemented to set off a trade war that would plunge the us economy into recession and cost more than million private sector american jobs moody s is only slightly less pessimistic zandi s team wrote that trump s policies would result in million fewer jobs after four years with unemployment rising to perhaps from its current level of the oecd on the other hand projected in november that the unemployment rate would fall by just under ppt by owing to trump s proposed fiscal stimulus those projections come with an important caveat however see next section trade skip to top in a september analysis the piie warned that trump s policies if implemented would set off a trade war see jobs above it may come as a surprise then that the oecd projected in november that real growth in global trade would accelerate by ppt to in and by ppt to in as a result of trump s policies canada and mexico the think tank wrote would reap particular benefits in light of trump s rhetoric on trade however and especially trade with mexico those forecasts come with a crucial caveat worsening protectionism and the threat of trade retaliation could offset much of the fiscal initiatives impact on domestic and global growth leaving countries with a poorer fiscal position as well inflation and interest rates skip to top the oecd forecast in november that fiscal policy stimulus would add ppt to inflation in and ppt in causing consumer price inflation to rise to around by the end of that year according to the bureau of labor statistics the consumer price index cpi rose in the twelve months to october the oecd expects rising inflation to impact monetary policy with the upper bound of the federal funds rate s target range rising to from its january level of trump s expected fiscal stimulus accounts for ppt of this projected increase after tax earnings skip to top the trump administration released the broad outline of a tax reform proposal in april but the lack of detail has made it difficult for experts to estimate potential changes to after tax earnings the following is based on plans released during the campaign the tax foundation wrote in september that it expects trump s plan to increase after tax earnings in every income quintile though the effect will be significantly larger at the top of the scale the bottom will see their after tax incomes rise by or by up to taking growth forecasts and other factors into account while the top will see theirs grow by at least and by up to the top meanwhile will see their after tax incomes rise by at least and by as much as the tax policy center reached similar conclusions in october each income quintile would see its after tax earnings rise under trump s plan with the benefits concentrated at the top households making over million in dollars the top of the population would see their tax bills fall by million in or of after tax income the poorest fifth of households would get a tax break worth the overall average tax cut would be or the tax policy center found that taxes would rise for many single parent and large families however due to trump s plan to repeal personal exemptions and the head of household filing status see taxes under economic policies below lily batchelder a visiting fellow at the think tank and ex deputy director of obama s national economic council wrote in october that around million households including of all households run by single parents would see their taxes rise under trump s plan tax policy center tax rates under current law and trump proposal single filers childless married couples filing jointly adjusted gross income up to current marginal rate trump marginal rate adjusted gross income up to current marginal rate trump marginal rate over over note only applies to filers who take the standard deduction bold typeface denotes a tax hike under trump s plan according to batchelder a single parent with three children can use the head of household deduction and three personal exemptions to reduce in taxable income to under current law under trump s plan those provisions would be replaced by a standard deduction resulting in of taxable income and a tax bill that is higher national debt skip to top the tax foundation estimated in september that trump s plan will lower federal tax revenues by trillion over the next decade on a static basis incorporating the boost to gdp growth the think tank forecasts federal tax revenue may decrease by trillion the fiscally hawkish committee for a responsible federal budget forecast in september that trump s policies would decrease revenue by trillion over ten years the public s share of federal debt at that time trillion or of gdp would rise to over of gdp over the same period compared to a baseline forecast of as of january the total national debt is just short of trillion or of annualized third quarter gdp the tax policy center estimated in october that trump s tax plans would reduce federal revenues by trillion over the first decade and an additional trillion in the second decade the think tank collaborated with the penn wharton budget model to produce two sets of estimates that take into account the macroeconomic effects of trump s plan both estimates forecast a short term boost to gdp growth which would offset the costs of trump s plan for five to eight years one sees gdp lagging behind the baseline estimate beginning in neither accounts for promised but unspecified spending cuts when rising interest payments are factored in the federal debt rises by trillion to of gdp over years in other words it more than doubles economic policies skip to top trump entered the white house flanked by republican majorities in both houses of congress but his prior clashes with republican leaders particularly with house speaker paul ryan suggest that he may have trouble passing his entire legislative agenda democrats meanwhile may act to block some of trump s proposals despite their congressional disadvantage what the following policies will look like when and if they become law is difficult to say but here are the positions trump has espoused during his campaign and the executive actions he s taken as of january trade skip to top u s trade policy and the manufacturing jobs trump blames it for shipping overseas were at the center of the president s platform on his campaign site trump promised to negotiate fair trade deals that create american jobs increase american wages and reduce america s trade deficit mexico and nafta mexico has come in for particular criticism trump repeatedly threatened to slap tariffs on cars imported from mexico beginning the day he announced his candidacy in june at billion vehicles were the largest category of imports from mexico in according to the u s trade representative s website trump has also singled out the north american free trade agreement nafta which he called the single worst trade deal ever approved in this country during the first presidential debate in september the deal which bill clinton signed in reduced trade barriers among mexico the u s and canada between and the nominal value of goods imported from mexico rose to billion according to the census bureau adjusted for inflation using the cpi the increase was the u s had a billion trade deficit with mexico in goods in but a billion surplus in services trump is expected to call for nafta to be renegotiated or to withdraw from it altogether he appears to have authority to pull out of the agreement by giving six months notice according to article of the treaty some experts believe he would need congress support however the new york times reported on january that trump plans to charge a tax on mexican imports in order to fund the construction of a border wall which he had ordered the previous day trans pacific partnership the trans pacific partnership tpp a trade agreement that the u s signed but did not come up for a ratification vote in congress would have reduced trade barriers among pacific rim nations the pact s prospects were already dim before trump s election made it a dead letter on january in a mostly symbolic move he ordered the u s to withdraw from the deal the tpp which excluded china formed the economic leg of the obama administration s rebalance to asia which hillary clinton spearheaded as secretary of state her democratic primary opponent senator bernie sanders of vermont and trump repeatedly attacked clinton for backing the deal leading her to retract support for it china has stepped into the vacuum with an alternative country trade pact called the regional comprehensive economic partnership china the president has also criticized china claiming that it suppresses the value of its currency the yuan in order to gain an export advantage while china maintained a dollar peg that held the yuan s value down from to the evidence now suggests the government is intervening to lift rather than lower the yuan s value the country s foreign currency reserves fell from nearly trillion in march to just over trillion in october even so trump promises to declare china a currency manipulator and impose tariffs of up to on its exports trump announced the formation of a new white house national trade council on december naming a vocally anti china economist peter navarro to head it among other books navarro has authored death by china confronting the dragon a global call to action and the coming china wars where they will be fought and how they could be won targeted interventions between winning the election and taking office trump unleashed a barrage of tweets calling out individual companies for outsourcing jobs on november he tweeted that he d received a call from ford motor co f chairman bill ford who advised me that he will be keeping the lincoln plant in kentucky no mexico the company s plan according to npr had been to shift lincoln production to mexico in order to increase production of ford escapes in louisville which it said would have had no effect on jobs a week later trump tweeted about negotiations with united technologies corp s utx subsidiary carrier which announced on november that it would not follow through with plans to move an indiana plant to mexico trump said he d saved over jobs wthr an nbc affiliate in indianapolis reported that the plant would only retain factory floor jobs and salaried positions with jobs still heading to mexico another carrier plant in indiana meanwhile still planned to send jobs to mexico vice president mike pence who was governor of indiana at the time offered carrier million in tax incentives over years to secure the deal trump continued to target individual companies including rexnord corp rxn for moving jobs to mexico boeing co ba for cost overruns on its replacement for air force one lockheed martin corp lmt twice for cost overruns on its f project in his second tweet trump called on boeing to price out a comparable f super hornet driving lockheed s share price down intraday general motors co gm for shipping mexican made chevy cruzes to the u s make in u s a or pay big border tax and toyota motor corp tm for building a plant in mexico to produce corollas for the u s market he also tweeted about his wins saying on december that softbank group corp s tyo ceo masayoshi son had agreed to invest billion in the u s toward businesses and new jobs he added masa said he would never do this had we trump not won the election similarly he thanked ford after the company announced on january that it would ditch plans to build a billion plan in mexico instead it would invest million in its flat rock michigan plant creating new jobs ceo mark fields told cnn the move was a vote of confidence in trump s pro growth policies and promises to decrease the regulatory burden on businesses despite the fact that its cars are cheaper to produce in mexico some economists have questioned whether trump s approach to repatriating jobs is sustainable given the scale of his deal making compared to the scale of the economy the country added net nonfarm payrolls in december alone for every deal trump strikes with a ford or a carrier to add or maintain a few hundred jobs other firms quietly follow through with plans to move jobs abroad the wall street journal reported on december the day after the carrier deal was announced that caterpillar inc cat rexnord despite trump s tweet manitowoc foodservice inc mfs and cts corp cts were still shifting operations abroad taxes skip to top on april the trump administration released a single page of bullet points outlining a proposed tax reform which if passed would be the first since below is the text of the document tax reform for economic growth and american jobs the biggest individual and business tax cut in american history goals for tax reform grow the economy and create millions of jobs simplify our burdensome tax code provide tax relief to american families especially middle income families lower the business tax rate from one of the highest in the world to one of the lowest individual reform tax relief for american families especially middle income families reducing the tax brackets to tax brackets of and doubling the standard deduction providing tax relief for families with child and dependent care expenses simplification eliminate targeted tax breaks that mainly benefit the wealthiest taxpayers protect the home ownership and charitable gift tax deductions repeal the alternative minimum tax repeal the death tax repeal the obamacare tax that hits small businesses and investment income business reform business tax rate territorial tax system to level the playing field for american companies one time tax on trillions of dollars held overseas eliminate tax breaks for special interests process throughout the month of may the trump administration will hold listening sessions with stakeholders to receive their input and will continue working with the house and senate to develop the details of a plan that provides massive tax relief creates jobs and makes america more competitive and can pass both chambers the document includes far less detail than proposals trump made during the campaign for example while it defines the rates at which individuals will be taxed it does not specify the income brackets those rates will apply to below are trump s previous proposals which may provide some insight into an eventual tax reform bill see here for more detail on the proposals trump made during the campaign as well as congressional republican proposals campaign proposals the trump campaign s tax plan would reduce the current seven brackets to three and apply these to federal income and capital gains taxes it would raise the standard deduction for joint filers from to itemized deductions would be capped at for joint filers these amounts would be halved for single filers trump would eliminate head of household filing status and personal exemptions trump plan tax brackets joint married filers single filers income tax capital gains tax up to up to to to over over source tax foundation the plan would to repeal the gift and estate taxes which trump calls a death tax while taxing capital gains over million that are held until death it would prevent contributions of appreciated assets into private charities which can be used to avoid capital gains taxes trump s tax proposal would eliminate a contentious loophole by taxing carried interest as regular income though the net effect on private equity and hedge funds might not be that large since they would likely qualify for the lower business rate see below trump also promised to repeal the alternative minimum tax and the tax on investment income applied by the affordable care act the proposal offered a deduction for children under and elder dependents limited to those with joint incomes below it would create dependent care savings accounts with annual contribution limits government matching at up to per year is available for lower income families definitions in this section alternative minimum tax head of household capital expenditure investment itemized deduction capital gains joint return filer capital gains tax marginal tax rate carried interest personal exemption corporate inversion single filer corporate business tax standard deduction estate tax tax bracket federal income tax tax holiday gift tax tax deductible interest interest expense deduction the top marginal business tax rate would fall to from today under the trump campaign s proposal he also proposed a tax holiday for corporations to repatriate profits held overseas at a rate these changes are expected to reduce incentives to increase the proportion of foreign earnings relative to domestic ones to hoard cash overseas and to shift tax bases to other countries through corporate inversions manufacturing firms would have the option to expense capital investment in exchange for giving up the corporate interest expense deduction after three years this election would become permanent the plan would also increase tax incentives for employers to provide onsite childcare facilities infrastructure skip to top trump has promised to dramatically increase infrastructure investment his most notable project is the wall he has promised to build along the border with mexico on january trump ordered the wall s immediate construction and instructed secretary of homeland security john kelly to identify an allocate all sources of federal funds to begin work trump insists that mexico will reimburse the u s for the cost of the wall which he has estimated at billion to billion independent estimates and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell have put the cost as high as billion trump s initial proposal to force mexico s hand involved amending the patriot act to disrupt the flow of remittances to mexico which his plan valued at billion per year trump said that move would force the mexican government to make a one time payment to fund the wall s construction in his january executive order trump instructed executive agencies to identify all aid to mexico including humanitarian and military funds suggesting those could be a source of funding for the project the next day press secretary sean spicer suggested that taxing mexican imports at could earn billion a year and easily pay for the wall just through that mechanism alone beyond the border wall trump has made early moves to encourage other infrastructure projects including a flurry of executive actions on january one of which set up a process to identify high priority projects and expedite environmental and other approvals the order specifically named improvements to the electrical grid and telecommunications systems as well as repairs and upgrades to highways bridges ports airports and pipelines pipelines were the focus of three additional presidential memos signed the same day two of the memos cleared the way for the construction of the controversial keystone xl and dakota access pipelines both of which the obama administration had rejected a third mandated that pipelines be built using american materials specifying that steel and iron products must be made in the u s from the initial melting stage through the application of coatings whether that stipulation will affect the economics of pipeline projects or run afoul of trade rules in keystone xl s case is unclear trillion in a contract laying out promises for his first hundred days in office trump proposed trillion in infrastructure investment over years adding that the spending would be revenue neutral in august he floated the idea of funding an billion to trillion investment through infrastructure bonds his campaign site says the money will come from private public partnerships cutting red tape eliminating wasteful spending and leverag ing new revenues despite his promise not to increase the deficit and occasional promises to eliminate the national debt few observers expect the infrastructure plan to be revenue neutral healthcare skip to top trump has promised to repeal and replace the affordable care act commonly known as obamacare which has seen premiums soar and competition erode on its signature exchanges in the early days of trump s administration there was little clarity about what would replace obamacare trump had proposed measures during the campaign such as expanding the use of health savings accounts hsas funding medicaid through block grants to states allowing insurers to sell across state lines importing drugs forming high risk pools cutting back on costs through stricter immigration policies allowing patients to deduct insurance premiums from their tax returns and allowing them to shop around for the most cost effective treatments a number of these proposals overlap with the empowering patients first act a bill introduced multiple times from to by tom price a u s representative and physician who was confirmed as the administration s health and human services secretary in february price s bill also focuses on protecting doctors from lawsuit abuse despite uncertainty about what would replace obamacare trump and congressional republicans moved ahead with repeal efforts the week prior to the inauguration senate republicans passed a budget resolution that would allow them to repeal much of the health law with a majority vote that is without the risk of a democratic filibuster the house approved the resolution which did not require president obama s signature the following day in his first day in office a friday trump signed an executive order instructing agency heads to exercise all authority and discretion available to them to waive defer grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of any provision or requirement of the act that would impose a fiscal burden on any state or a cost fee tax penalty or regulatory burden on individuals families healthcare providers health insurers patients recipients of healthcare services purchasers of health insurance or makers of medical devices products or medications the order appeared to be intended to allow parts of the law to lapse due to lack of enforcement in a press conference the following monday press secretary sean spicer declined to say whether the administration would enforce the individual mandate which penalizes those who do not obtain insurance american health care act on march house republicans unveiled a plan to replace obamacare a bill called the american health care act ahca the proposed law would scrap the individual mandate the obamacare provision that has come in for the most criticism from republicans in order to prevent younger healthier people from going without insurance and driving up premiums for remaining customers the proposal adds a penalty to premiums for individual market insurees who have let their insurance lapse the bill would also eliminate the employer mandate which penalizes businesses that have or more full time employees and do not offer insurance the ahca would get rid of subsidies for out of pocket expenses in and change the way that premium subsidies are provided for example according to the cbo a year old with an annual income of of the federal poverty level would receive in tax credits under current law under the republican proposal that subsidy would fall to however due to lower premiums that individual would pay altogether compared to under current law a year old with the same income would receive in premiums under current law under the ahca they would receive meaning they would pay compared to under obamacare a year old with an income of of the poverty level would receive the same subsidy and pay the same premium as someone their age making of their income under current law they would receive no subsidy and pay obamacare vs ahca subsidies for nongroup health insurance individual with annual income poverty level current law premium tax credit net premium paid years old years old years old ahca premium tax credit net premium paid change years old years old years old individual with annual income poverty level current law premium tax credit net premium paid years old years old years old ahca premium tax credit net premium paid change years old years old years old source congressional budget office cbo the ahca would increase contribution limits to hsas and allow insurers to charge older patients five times more than they do younger ones rather than the current ratio of three it would maintain the current medicaid funding scheme for states that chose to expand the program under obamacare until after that it would reduce funding for new sign ups and capping federal funding on a per capita basis the proposal would keep some obamacare provisions allowing children to stay on their parents plans until age for example and preventing insurers from denying coverage based on pre existing conditions effects on insurance coverage premiums and the deficit according to an analysis the cbo published in mid march the ahca would result in million more americans lacking health coverage by the figure would rise to million by in a total of million people would lack insurance compared to a projection of million under obamacare much of the reduction in coverage would be due to younger and healthier patients choice to forgo insurance in the absence of the individual mandate shortly before his inauguration trump told the washington post we re going to have insurance for everybody there was a philosophy in some circles that if you can t pay for it you don t get it that s not going to happen with us premiums would initially be higher than under current law but within a decade they would be around lower the cbo did not project that either obamacare or the ahca would destabilize health insurance markets the cbo projects that the federal deficit would be around billion lower from to under the ahca than under current law regulation skip to top trump has railed against what he has characterized as excessive stifling regulation in an executive order signed on january trump instructed agencies to identify two regulations to be eliminated for every new one they adopted a first step to fulfilling a campaign promise he also mandated that the incremental cost of new and eliminated regulations not exceed zero in fiscal which ends on september because repealing rules often involves a process nearly as complex as the one involved in making them however it may be difficult to keep costs that low trump also promised to cancel every unconstitutional executive action memorandum and order issued by president obama he has been particularly critical of energy regulations meant to curb pollution and climate change his nominee for administrator of the environmental protection agency epa scott pruitt sued the agency a number of times over its regulations when he was oklahoma s attorney general see energy below shortly after his election victory trump promised to dismantle the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act a financial regulation law that passed the house without a single republican vote and the senate with only three steven mnuchin trump s pick for secretary of the treasury said the law was way too complicated and cuts back lending in a november interview with cnbc he identified the volcker rule which aims to prevent banks from making risky bets with consumer deposits as a particular source of unneeded complexity in an executive order issued february he laid out principles he said should guide financial regulation while the order did not mention dodd frank it was perceived as an attack on the law immigration skip to top trump made immigration a centerpiece of his campaign from the time he announced his candidacy in june in that speech he offered this description of mexican immigrants they re bringing drugs they re bringing crime they re rapists and some i assume are good people he proposed building a wall along the southern border and changing federal law to prevent those born in the u s to undocumented parents from automatically gaining citizenship it is not clear whether a change in the law would be sufficient to eliminate birthright citizenship or if a constitutional amendment would be needed he initially advocated deporting all undocumented immigrants in the united states an estimated million people and in december called for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country s representatives can figure out what is going on he later moderated those positions slightly promising instead to deport criminal aliens whose number he put at two million that estimate has been disputed he also walked back his ban on muslim immigration calling instead for a suspension of immigration from terror prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur he has called for extreme vetting of everyone entering the u s mexico in a pair of executive orders on january trump ordered the immediate construction of the wall as well as new detention centers he ordered an end to what he called catch and release and asylum abuse writing that parole should be granted only for urgent humanitarian reasons or a significant public benefit carving out an exception to his earlier hiring freeze he ordered additional border patrol agents to be hired he ordered agencies to employ all lawful means to ensure the faithful execution fo the immigration laws of the united states against all removable aliens prioritizing criminals and those who have abused any program related to receipt of public benefits the order did not specify which benefits are meant whether public schools count for example or what constitutes abuse trump also ordered the attorney general his nominee jeff sessions is awaiting senate confirmation to cut off federal funds to sanctuary cities and called for the creation of a database detailing crimes committed by undocumented immigrants who will be exempted from privacy act protections middle east on the afternoon of january a friday trump signed an order barring the entry of all refugees for days shutting out refugees from syria indefinitely and imposing a day ban of all entrants immigrant and nonimmigrant from seven muslim majority countries yemen iraq iran syria sudan libya and somalia the ban was rapidly enforced in airports across the country which soon attracted protesters permanent residents were detained since the administration did not immediately clarify that these were exempt judges in four states issued emergency stays against the order over the following weekend preventing those who had been detained from being deported few were released however and reports indicated that some people were being deported anyway the order caps fiscal refugee admissions at less than half the obama administration s goal for the year it prioritizes applicants who are religious minorities and facing religious persecution which some have interpreted as favoring christians in line with trump s promised muslim ban but could in theory apply to sunnis in majority shi a iraq for example the order also creates another database documenting charges and convictions for terror offenses by foreign nationals as well as cases of gender based violence such as honor killings this database is in addition to one trump created to track crimes committed by undocumented immigrants national debt skip to top trump repeatedly criticized the growth of the national debt which stands at nearly trillion as of january under the obama administration in march trump told the washington post that he could eliminate the debt within eight years during the vice presidential debate mike pence said when we get back to to growth which donald trump s plan will do then we re going to have the resources to meet our nation s needs at home and abroad and we re going to have the ability to bring down the national debt independent analyses on the other hand see trump s plan to lower taxes and boost spending on infrastructure and defense as adding trillions to the debt see national debt under economic forecasts above in may trump appeared to indicate that he would consider repaying less than the full amount the u s had borrowed while his statements were unclear and he denied he was talking about with a re negotiation he argued you can buy back at discounts you can do things with discounts and i would borrow knowing that if the economy crashed you could make a deal energy skip to top donald trump has repeatedly called climate change a hoax and in he tweeted the concept of global warming was created by and for the chinese in order to make u s manufacturing non competitive given this stance and his enthusiastic courting of voters in appalachia s coal country trump s positions favoring fossil fuels shouldn t come as a surprise in his promises for his first hundred days he said he will lift the restrictions on the production of trillion dollars worth of job producing american energy reserves including shale oil natural gas and clean coal his nominee to head the epa oklahoma attorney general scott pruitt has said the debate on climate change is far from settled shortly after taking office trump signed a series of executive orders and memos calling for the resumption of work on the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines which the obama administration had rejected in an order that laid out a process for expediting environmental approvals for high priority projects trump named pipelines as an important category of infrastructure projects a new requirement that pipelines be constructed from local content however could make them more costly see infrastructure above in may trump said he would renegotiate last year s paris agreement which saw the u s china and other states pledge to limit average global temperature rises to well below degrees celsius above pre industrial levels later in the month he threatened to cancel it his plan for the first hundred days includes a promise to cancel billions in payments to u n climate change programs and use the money to fix america s water and environmental infrastructure monetary policy skip to top trump has been at his least consistent when it comes to monetary policy he said the fed was creating a bubble with low interest rates in august he warned the following may that raising rates could strengthen the dollar and cause some very major problems adding that the dovish federal reserve chair janet yellen is a very capable person by september he was back to criticizing low rates as well as charging the fed with doing political things and being more political than secretary clinton the fed has a congressional mandate to generate maximum employment to unemployment and steady prices annual core pce inflation of aside from those requirements however it is independent meaning it does not have to seek approval from any branch of government to change monetary policy given trump s accusations that the fed is acting politically some have expressed the worry that trump will attempt to curtail monetary policy independence as several past presidents have done narayana kocherlakota who was president of the minneapolis fed until december wrote the week after trump s victory there is absolutely nothing in u s law preventing trump from violating the fed s independence a post development that rests largely on the restraint of the president budget skip to top on march the office of management
