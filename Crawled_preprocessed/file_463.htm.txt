register number the financial services compensation scheme fscs provides u k investment protection up to gbp and cash protection up to gbp ib is highly regarded on wall street and in the trading and investment communities not surprisingly reports of bad executions shady dealings or cash mismanagement are exceptionally rare fat finger forex executions which plague many smaller brokers can happen but odds are very low because ib does not make markets against its customers millionsipc insurance coverage millionlloyd s of london umbrella coverage what you need to knowinteractive brokers ceo thomas peterffy is considered an industry pioneer bringing standalone computerized trading into the st century while making ib a top choice for at home and small office professional traders as well as fund and money managers the trader workstation tws trading platform is a highly mature software product constantly updated providing an industrial strength interface for the risky business of market speculation special features ib s risk navigator provides a comprehensive portfolio risk management platform that allows easy identification of hidden exposures multiple reports using real time data present a risk summary from different perspectives allowing customers to drill down from the portfolio s top line results into successive detail layers a video tour of this special feature s capabilities gets users up and running quickly so they can create illuminating risk reports ib risk navigator what if analysis using real time datatrader s universitylibrary of webinars apps and glossaries probability labtws or mobile based application deciphering options markets what you need to knowinteractive brokers offers a variety of tools for education analysis and trade planning however finding these resources can be a daunting task because they re deeply embedded in the tws platform often requiring several menu drill downs information on applying these tools is scattered across the ib website contributing to a sense of disorganization although the tools themselves offer great value desktop experience the standalone trader workstation tws offers a powerful proprietary trading platform that has benefited from more than a decade of upgrades and enhancements however be forewarned that the learning curve is steep because the software s java core is text based requiring deep drilling into menus to configure trading and data screens for different requirements once mastered the interface can perform powerful and sophisticated trading and analysis functions in line with the needs of professionals and serious minded trader hobbyists prosnavigating between market venues and instruments is easy and intuitive once you ve mastered the software trade execution is lightning fast but unforgiving so check twice before loading in market orders and hitting the entry button most trading categories can open into secondary screens that offer more comprehensive data and execution capabilities for example fx trader presents a more traditional view of currency pairs with boxed pairs highlighting pip changes in multiple colors meanwhile fx matrix provides a snapshot of the most popular pairs in an easy to read format that quickly identifies emerging opportunities conscharting capabilities are unusually weak and incomplete compared to many brokerage systems a drawback compounded by the sophistication of other platform features the platform lacks long look back periods industrial strength indicators or easily managed chart views ib has made improvements over the years in reaction to customer complaints but many users will need to tap other sources to meet their technical analysis requirements see platform walkthrough mobile experience ib tws for android and ios offer slimmed down versions of the desktop software in a clear and easy to read format the interface uses ib key technology requiring that you input a pin or swipe as an additional authorization layer prosthe apps support watchlists orders trades scanners alerts notifications portfolio news and market briefs configuration is much simpler than the desktop experience offering adequate access to positions while away from the trading desk balances margins funds and market values are easily obtained without menu drilling ironically charting is better than on the desktop version with a variety of indicators and a clean interface consmobile tws may be inadequate if you trade actively place sophisticated order types or incur large capital risk it provides no access to more complex tools or venue specific interfaces like fx trader or fx matrix logging into the mobile version also shuts down the desktop automatically even if accessed from the same i p address this can be frustrating for at home traders wanting to follow the market and trade positions when running downstairs to make lunch or sitting on the patio to take a break see platform walkthrough customer support interactive brokers offers several support options including phone and live chat security issues such as resets or security tokens must be handled by phone a comprehensive knowledge base is also provided with excellent look up facilities common tasks like fund transfers account changes and tax reporting can be handled through the web based account management interface live chatemail what you need to knowib s hour phone access is available during market days but shifts to foreign venues overnight making contact more difficult the chat function can generate unusual wait times especially during infrequent outages fees are usually waived for trades placed by phone during outages chat room personnel are extremely knowledgeable about tws software and can guide new users through inevitable roadblocks research insights research and insight can be accessed through tws functionality broker website and web based account management some options require an additional payment for

selection of decision making analytical and research tools including fundamental and technical insight upgrades downgrades market signals and commentary by the trading community secondary account management and web based research offer portfolio and performance overviews valuable for analyzing returns and making investment decisions consresearch and insight tools feel scattered and disorganized lacking a central access portal headline information is often brief poorly organized and confusing making additional data mining more difficult the right click context based access makes it difficult to answer specific inquiries or organize multiple information sources generating more frustration than information the overall lack of easy information gathering can be frustrating for clients looking for a one stop destination for their analytical needs education interactive brokers provides web based seminars you can access live or by watching at a later date many programs focus on software and broker education but the growing library of market focused topics does a good job of building client skills traders universityfree webinars short courses tours and appstraders academylonger course materialtraders insightdaily market pulse and performance what you need to knowib s educational offerings cover a variety of market topics in detail but large scale omissions undermine the user experience for example traders academy is intended to provide more detailed course material but has just two programs tws for beginners and an introduction to options short videos in the traders university section offer greater variety with entries on technical analysis short selling cfds options and forex as well as tutorials on tws and mobile platforms bottom line interactive brokers covers markets in countries offering ultra low commissions and tight spreads its data feed is highly reliable rarely going offline while trade executions are accurate and lightning fast due to sophisticated order routing technology the mature trading platform easily handles complex order entry while an excellent api supports algorithmic strategies making this an industrial strength broker dealer and top choice for professionals and serious minted hobbyists clients coming from other broker dealers may feel intimidated by the proprietary trading platform but taking the time to learn the software s quirks pays immediate dividends opening complex strategies not available at a typical discount house while interactive brokers provides dozens of analytical and research tools some customers may prefer to use third party products that better organize the needed information the same holds true with technical charting which has been the weakest aspect of the tws platform since its inception reviewed by alan farley january alan farley is a private trader and author of the mcgraw hill best sellers the master swing trader and the master swing trader toolkit he s been on the market
