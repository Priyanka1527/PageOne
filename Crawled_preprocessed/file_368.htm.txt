and when risk becomes reality a well prepared business can moderate the risk s impact dollar losses lost time and productivity and the negative impact on customers can all be minimized for startup businesses and established organizations the ability to identify which risks pose a threat to successful operations is a key component of strategic business planning business risks are identified using a myriad of methods but each identifying strategy relies on a comprehensive analysis of specific business activities that could present challenges to the company under most business models organizations face preventable strategic and external threats that can be managed through acceptance transfer reduction or elimination below are the main types of risk that can affect a business physical risks building risks are the most common type of physical risk fire or explosions are the most common risk to a building to manage this risk and the risk to employees it s important to do the following make sure all employees know the exact street address of the building to give the operator in case of emergency know the location of all exits install fire alarms and smoke detectors a sprinkler system will provide additional protection to the physical plant equipment documents and of course personnel inform all employees that in the event of emergency their personal safety takes priority over everything else tell them to leave the building and abandon all work associated documents equipment and or products hazardous material risk from spills or accidents also occur with some regularity among the hazardous materials most frequently spilled or released into the atmosphere of a workplace are acid gas toxic fumes toxic dust or filings poisonous liquids or waste fire department hazardous material units are prepared to handle these types of disaster people who work with these materials however should be properly equipped and trained to handle them safely a plan should be created and implemented to handle the immediate effects of these risks government agencies and local fire departments may help in acquiring information to prevent these accidents as well as

are nearby fires storm damage floods hurricane or tornado earthquake and other natural disasters employees should be familiar with streets leading in and out of the neighborhood on all sides of the place of business keep sufficient fuel in your vehicles to drive out of and away from the neighborhood liability or property and casualty insurance are often used to transfer the financial burdens of location risks to a third party or a business insurance company human risks alcoholism and drug abuse are major risks to personnel in the work force employees suffering from these conditions should be urged to seek treatment counseling and rehabilitation if necessary some insurance policies may provide partial coverage for the cost of treatment protecting against embezzlement theft and fraud may be difficult but these are crimes which occur frequently in the workplace a system of double signature requirements for checks invoice and payables verification can help prevent embezzlement and fraud stringent accounting procedures may discover embezzlement or fraud a thorough background check before hiring personnel can uncover previous offenses in the applicant s past while this may not necessarily be grounds for declining to hire an applicant placement for the new hire in a critical position in which money and cash equivalents are used may not be judicious illness or injury among the workforce is inevitable and is always a problem to prevent loss of productivity assign and train backup personnel to handle the work of critical employees when they are absent due to a health related concern technology risks power outage is perhaps the most common of the technology risks auxiliary gas driven power generators are a good back up system to provide electrical energy for lighting and other functions until utility power is restored in manufacturing plants several large auxiliary generators can keep a factory operational until utility power is restored computers may be kept up and running with high performance back up batteries power surges may occur during a lightning storm or randomly so critical business systems should be furnished with surge protection devices to avoid loss of documents and destruction of equipment offline and online data back up systems should be used to protect critical documents although telephone and communications failure is relatively uncommon risk managers may consider providing emergency use only company cell phones to personnel whose use of the phone or internet is critical to their business strategic risks strategy risks are not altogether undesirable financial institutions such as banks or credit unions take on strategy risk through lending to consumers while pharmaceutical companies are exposed to strategy risk through research and development of a new drug each of these strategy related risks are inherent to an organization s business objectives when structured efficiently acceptance of strategy risks can create highly profitable operations companies exposed to a great deal of strategy risk can mitigate the potential for negative consequences by creating and maintaining infrastructures that support high risk projects a system established to control the financial hardship that occurs when a risky venture fails often includes diversification of current projects strong cash flow or the ability to finance new projects in an affordable way and a comprehensive process to review and analyze potential ventures based on future return on investment making a risk assessment after the risks have been identified they must be prioritized in accordance with your assessment of their probability establish a probability scale for purposes of risk assessment for example risks may be very likely to occur some chance of occurrence small chance of occurrence very little chance of occurrence other risks must be prioritized and managed in accordance to their probability of occurring actuarial tables statistical analysis of the probability of any risk occurring and the potential financial damage ensuing from the occurrence of those risks may be accessed online and can provide guidance in prioritizing risk insuring against potential risks insurance is a principle safeguard in managing risk and many risks are insurable fire insurance is a necessity for any business that occupies a physical space whether owned outright or rented and should be a top priority product liability insurance as an obvious example is not necessary in a service business some risks are inarguably high priority such as the risk of fraud or embezzlement if employees handle money or perform accounting duties in accounts payable and receivable specialized insurance companies will underwrite a cash bond to provide financial coverage in the event of embezzlement theft or fraud when insuring against potential risks never assume a best case scenario even if employees have worked for years with no problems and their service has been exemplary insurance against employee error may be a necessity the extent of insurance coverage against injury will depend on the nature of your business a heavy manufacturing plant will of course require more extensive coverage for employees product liability insurance is also a necessity if a business relies heavily on computerized data customer lists and accounting data for example exterior backup and insurance coverage are mandatory finally hiring a risk management consultant may be a prudent step in the prevention and management of risks to learn more read insurance coverage a

plan for the safety inspection of the physical premises and equipment should be developed and implemented regularly including the training and education of personnel when necessary a periodic
