of currency is falling central banks attempt to limit inflation and avoid deflation in order to keep the economy running smoothly breaking down inflation as a result of inflation the purchasing power of a unit of currency falls for example if the inflation rate is then a pack of gum that costs in a given year will cost the next year as goods and services require more money to purchase the implicit value of that money falls the federal reserve uses core inflation data which excludes volatile industries such as food and energy prices external factors can influence prices on these types of goods which does not necessarily reflect the overall rate of inflation removing these industries from inflation data paints a much more accurate picture of the state of inflation the fed s monetary policy goals include moderate long term interest rates price stability and maximum employment and each of these goals is intended to promote a stable financial environment the federal reserve clearly communicates long term inflation goals in order to keep a steady long term rate of inflation which in turn maintains price stability price stability or a relatively constant level of inflation allows businesses to plan for the future since they know what to expect it also allows the fed to promote maximum employment which is determined by nonmonetary factors that fluctuate over time and are therefore subject to change for this reason the fed doesn t set a specific goal for maximum employment and it is largely determined by members assessments maximum employment does not mean zero unemployment as at any given time people there is a certain level of volatility as people vacate and start new jobs monetarism theorizes that inflation is related to the money supply of an economy for example following the spanish conquest of the aztec and inca empires massive amounts of gold and especially silver flowed into the spanish and other european economies since the money supply had rapidly increased prices spiked and the value of money fell contributing to economic collapse historical examples of inflation and hyperinflation today few currencies are fully backed by gold or silver since most world currencies are fiat money the money supply could increase rapidly for political reasons resulting in inflation the most famous example is the hyperinflation that struck the german weimar republic in the early s the nations that had been victorious in world war i demanded reparations from germany which could not be paid in german paper currency as this was of suspect value due to government borrowing germany attempted to print paper notes buy foreign currency with them and use that to pay their debts this policy led to the rapid devaluation of the german mark and with it hyperinflation german consumers exacerbated the cycle by trying to spend their money as fast as possible expecting that it would be worth less and less the longer they waited more and more money flooded the economy and its value plummeted to the point where people would paper their walls with the practically worthless bills similar situations have occurred in peru in and zimbabwe in inflation and the global recession central banks have tried to learn from such episodes using monetary policy tools to keep inflation in check since the financial crisis the u s federal reserve has kept interest rates near zero and pursued a bond buying program now discontinued known as quantitative easing some critics of the program alleged it would cause a spike in inflation in the u s dollar but inflation peaked in and declined steadily over the next eight years there are many complex reasons why qe didn t lead to inflation or hyperinflation though the simplest explanation is that the recession was a strong deflationary environment and quantitative easing ameliorated its effects inflation in moderation harms and benefits while excessive inflation and hyperinflation have negative economic consequences deflation s negative consequences for the economy can be just as bad or worse consequently policy makers since the end of the th century have attempted to keep inflation steady at per year the european central bank has also pursued aggressive quantitative easing to counter deflation in the eurozone and some places have experienced negative interest rates due to fears that deflation could take hold in the eurozone and lead to economic stagnation moreover countries that are experiencing higher rates of growth can absorb higher rates of inflation india s target is around brazil s real world example of inflation inflation is generally measured in terms of a consumer price index cpi which tracks the prices of a basket of core goods and services over time viewed another way this tool measures the real that is adjusted for inflation value of earnings over time it is important to note that the components of the cpi do not change in price at the same rates or even necessarily move the same direction for example the prices of secondary education and housing have been increasing much more rapidly than the prices of other goods and services meanwhile fuel prices have risen fallen risen again and fallen again each time very sharply in the past ten years inflation is one of the primary reasons that people invest in the first place just as the pack of gum that costs a dollar will cost in a year assuming inflation a savings account that was worth would be worth after years and after years assuming that you earn no interest on the deposit stuffing cash into a mattress or buying a tangible asset like gold may make sense to people who live in unstable economies or who lack legal recourse however for those who can trust that their money will be reasonably safe if they make prudent equity or bond investments this is arguably the way to go there is still risk of course bond issuers can default and companies that issue stock can go under for this reason it s important to do solid research and create a diverse portfolio but in order to keep inflation from steadily gnawing away at your money it s important to invest it in assets that can be reasonably be expected to yield at a greater rate than inflation for further reading on this subject check out the inflation tutorial dictionary a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z content
