tick intervals rather than intervals of time what makes trendlines so universal in usage and appeal is they can be used to help identify trends regardless of the time period timeframe or interval used

all three price points she has an upward trend the trendline drawn has a positive slope and is therefore telling the analyst to buy in the direction of the trend if company a s price goes from to
