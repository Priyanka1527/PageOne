described an unverified report that mt gox a popular bitcoin exchange may have lost nearly btc the bitcoin currency unit this figure would be worth above million at current prices a few hours later he posted his source a document entitled crisis strategy draft on the digital library site scribd it outlines a desperate four part plan to save mt gox from insolvency according to fox business mt gox ceo mark karpeles admitted to industry consultant jon fisher in an internet chat that the document was more or less accurate though he denied it originated from mt gox here is a screenshot of the supposed mt gox strategy timeline from the document which appears to be in the form of a powerpoint deck almost immediately after this crisis strategy draft was posted trading on mt gox halted and users started seeing a notification that trading was disabled image source coindesk soon thereafter mt gox s site went down completely displaying nothing but a blank page and reports of the mt gox outage hit mainstream media outlets such as coindesk the top bitcoin news site and the new york times also on the evening of february industry leaders teamed up to release a defensive joint statement about mt gox s insolvency assuring the public that mt gox s incompetence was an exception and not the rule and that the industry as a whole was far more trustworthy on the morning of the th mt gox s site displayed the following in plain text dear mtgox customers in light of recent news reports and the potential repercussions on mtgox s operations and the market a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users we will be closely monitoring the situation and will react accordingly best regards mtgox team the price of bitcoin took a hit on the morning of the th the winkdex an index of bitcoin s price calculated using a volume weighted average of the top three exchanges stood around the following night it hit a low of but as of the time of this writing the price has rebounded to this morning mt gox added this message february th dear mtgox customers as there is a lot of speculation regarding mtgox and its future i would like to use this opportunity to reassure everyone that i am still in japan and working very hard with the support of different parties to find a solution to our recent issues furthermore i would like to kindly ask that people refrain from asking questions to our staff they have been instructed not to give any response or information please visit this page for further announcements and updates sincerely mark karpeles in order to fully understand this debacle some background is necessary what is bitcoin bitcoin is a digital currency started in it follows the ideas set out in a white paper by the mysterious satoshi nakamoto whose true identity has yet to be verified bitcoin offers the promise of lower transaction fees than traditional online payment mechanisms it is operated by decentralized authority unlike government issued currencies bitcoin balances are kept using public and private keys just long strings of numbers and letters that are linked through the mathematical encryption algorithm that was used to create them the public key comparable to a bank account number serves as the address which is published to the world and to which others may send bitcoin the private key comparable to an atm pin is meant to be a guarded secret and only used to authorize bitcoin transmissions there are no physical bitcoins only balances associated with these public and private keys these balances are kept on a public ledger along with all bitcoin transactions that is verified by a massive amount of computing power in order for someone to tamper with this public ledger someone would need to control over half of the computing power dedicated to verifying the bitcoin ledger and purposely use that power with ill intention the independent individuals and companies who own this computing power and participate in the network also known as miners are motivated by mining rewards the release of new bitcoin and transaction fees paid in bitcoin these miners can be thought of as the decentralized authority enforcing the credibility of the bitcoin network new bitcoin is being released to the miners at a fixed but periodically declining rate such that the total supply of bitcoin approaches million the amount released to date is million bitcoin one bitcoin is divisible to eight decimal places and if necessary and if the participating miners accept the change could in the future be made divisible to even more decimal places what exactly is mt gox mt gox is a bitcoin exchange based in tokyo japan one of bitcoin s first exchanges mt gox went online july of and until recently had been the largest exchange in terms of popularity and volume offering fast transactions and low fees when it was operating users could register an account and exchange fiat currency for bitcoin and vice versa orders could be placed through the website or through the mt gox application programming interface api which allows some actions on the site to be automated orders could be placed at the market price and would execute almost immediately or could be placed at a specified price unfulfilled orders could also be canceled from the u s before a citation by the department of homeland security in may users could send usd to mt gox through the online money sending service dwolla after the citation the only way to get cash into mt gox from the us was to do an international wire transfer from the eu users could do a single euro payments area sepa bank transfer for two factor authentication mt gox permitted the use of yubikeys usb mountable devices as usb drives are which provide a secondary step for authentication when employing a yubikey users would have to both enter a password and mount their yubikey on one of the computer s usb ports in order to be authenticated mt gox was responsible for holding its users balances in both fiat and bitcoin though it is never recommended to use exchanges for storing bitcoin or fiat for that matter the general guideline is that only an amount you wish to use for trading should be left on an exchange what supposedly brought down mt gox mt gox paused all bitcoin withdrawals on february th blaming a well known issue with the bitcoin protocol called transaction malleability whereby the id of a transaction may be tampered with before being approved by the bitcoin network and in the crisis strategy draft it is claimed that almost were missing due to malleability related theft bitcoin transaction malleability is an aspect of the bitcoin protocol that mt gox was apparently not accounting for which could have led them to mishandle transaction verifications this apparent slip up could have allowed people to steal bitcoins from mt gox by requesting a withdrawal listening over the network for when mt gox transmitted the transaction to the bitcoin network duplicating the transaction changing the transaction id and then propagating the modified version across the network ahead of the original one this avenue of attack would have caused the originally requested amount to be sent but with a different transaction id than that which mt gox originally placed on the transaction then the thief could claim the bitcoin withdrawal never got sent even though s he had received the balance if not properly aware of transaction malleability it is feasible and seems likely that at some point mt gox had an automated system in place that checked only the transaction id before attempting to resend the funds in order to be protected from such an attack mt gox would have also had to be checking whether the balance had been sent to the intended address instead it seems likely that mt gox s automated system would recognize that the transaction with the id they had originally transmitted to the network did not make it into the public ledger the system would then take this to mean the funds were not transferred out and would resend the funds thus over time thieves would have been able to rob mt gox repeatedly as is claimed by the crisis strategy draft a basic and yet unanswered question is this if the crisis strategy draft is correct how could mt gox have been getting robbed for so long the crisis strategy draft claims this went on for years and not have noticed the basic accounting mismatch between their user accounts and their stores of bitcoins mt gox s beleagured history mt gox has long been plagued by problems in june a significant security breach occurred wherein account usernames and encrypted passwords were compromised and in may the u s department of homeland security cited them for operating as an unregistered money transmitter in the u s these problems as well as issues with unfulfilled fund withdrawals from the exchange which have been mounting over the past several months and a general lack of professional communication have led many familiar with bitcoin to decry mt gox s incompetence on his popular podcast let s talk bitcoin in the episode mt gox and malleability published on february th andreas antonopoulos said the problem with mt gox was its clownish and incompetent management from the top that has persisted for three years anders brownworth cambridge ma based disruptive technology guru described mt gox in an interview with investopedia as more of a mom and pop company and says that the february problems were not entirely unexpected anders also said that overall it s a very good thing when a weak player disappears what does the mt gox meltdown mean for bitcoin s future anders comment illustrates that those in the bitcoin community do not see the events with mt gox as all gloom and doom the brookline ma based james d angelo dubbed by some as a bitcoin evangelist drew a comparison to the incident in october of last year when silk road where bitcoin was used to purchase illegal goods was brought down by law enforcement d angelo told investopedia when silk road went down the price dropped more than it did on february with silk road everyone thought that would be the end of bitcoin because the bitcoin economy seemed to be riding on silk road but actually it was a great weight lifted off of people s shoulders that seems to be the case with mt gox as well the bottom line mt gox is an exchange created in the early days of bitcoin that is run by inexperienced management its likely insolvency and seemingly imminent demise is something that has been long expected by many in the community and while it is quite a tarnish on the industry to have the once largest exchange go under mt gox s demise does not point to the failure of bitcoin and the rest of the industry is eager to move past the mt gox debacle disclosure the author owns some bitcoin trending a stock sell off vocabulary guide why the year u s
