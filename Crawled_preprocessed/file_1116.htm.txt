quality robinhood review by claire boyte white january a lean mean app based brokerage touting commission free stock and etf trading and an intuitive though basic trading interface open an account overall rating return to broker center robinhood fast facts robinhood is a brokerage that was founded specifically to bring the market to the masses developed in by stanford university students vlad tenev and baiju bhatt robinhood s streamlined structure is meant to make trading stocks and etfs quick simple and most important free this new take on investing has garnered plenty of attention and earned the startup a whopping million in investments even before it had a product to launch due to the success of the apps robinhood is now working to launch a web based platform which should be available in early pros streamlined interface no frills app based platform is simple and intuitive to use commission free robinhood never charges any fees for buying or selling stocks and etfs no account minimum for basic accounts opening an account is free and cash accounts have no account minimums easy to understand margin fees instead of using aprs margin loans incur a simple monthly fee based on the amount borrowed free bank transfers ach transfers to or from your account are always free cons bare bones charts charts show only tick information and historical price data and cannot be customized no web based platform yet with trading only available via app this is not ideal for those who need larger screens or aren t tech savvy negligible research and education neither the website nor the app provides educational resources in depth analysis or research tools real time data not guaranteed though actual app use shows quote data is real time and streaming terms and conditions specify that data may be delayed by up to minutes founded web platform waitlist million number of users products fees robinhood s ethos is built entirely upon providing the cheapest possible trading services to consumers while the platform doesn t offer a wide range of securities focusing instead on stocks and etfs there s never a commission on in application trades what s more robinhood has reinvented the traditional margin account framework instead of charging an annual interest rate which can be confusing to inexperienced traders this brokerage has attempted to make margin trading more accessible by breaking its margin rates into flat monthly fees based on total account equity and amount borrowed this makes it easy for clients to borrow as much or as little as they need with a tiered loan structure that focuses on smaller margin loans just like its trading commissions robinhood s focus on keeping costs low translates to some of the most competitive margin rates in the industry stock etf free us listed foreign securities euroclear stocks canadian stocks options free futures not available otc pink sheet not available preferred shares not available ipos not available mutual funds not available annuities not available bonds fixed income not available forex not available trust like any good brokerage robinhood is a member of both finra and the sipc it has insurance under the sipc that provides a per client limit of with a sublimit for cash claims robinhood has also secured additional insurance through lloyd s of london and other london underwriters to provide excess coverage for clients should the standard sipc limits not suffice mtotal aggregate insurance total aggregate cash insurance what you need to knowbesides providing insurance robinhood takes your online security very seriously in addition to using tps encryption and cookies on its website robinhood s apps offer multiple layers of security standard username and password login credentials can be paired with two factor authentication using sms security codes for each login attempt to ensure no one but you can access your account if you already have fingerprint id set up on your iphone the robinhood app will automatically enable touch id login making jumping in and out of the app a breeze special features because the robinhood platform is built to be as lean as possible it s not particularly heavy on special features this is not a platform for data junkies or day traders though you can day trade as long as you have or more in equity in your account while robinhood s fees are quite possibly the lowest in the industry you ll have to look elsewhere for your research backtesting tools or screeners the platform is built for new investors who may be overwhelmed by all those bells and whistles as well as those who know what they want to do and just need a quick cheap brokerage through which to execute pre researched trades free stockfor referring friendsas a new user you can earn one free share of stock by signing up a friend robinhood instantdeposits up to instantly accessiblefunds from sales instantly available as well day trade trackinglimited to trades per rolling five daysfor the same security what you need to knowthis platform is not built for traders who need all their tools and resources in one place however for active traders who diy their research and data analysis anyway robinhood is a great tool for cutting down costs if fees are a concern you might consider using another free platform that has a more robust selection of features for research and then placing trades on robinhood the app s built in consumer protections provide training wheels for new investors and are designed to help prevent high risk investing by inexperienced users but for day traders who understand and are comfortable with the risks of trading high volatility securities and who want to take advantage of margin trading leverage those consumer protections may make this platform a bad fit desktop experience as of this writing robinhood doesn t have a desktop or web based platform however a web based version is set to roll out in early and more than people have already signed up for the wait list the new platform is anticipated to be considerably more robust than the current mobile app but may still not include quite the suite of features other free platforms tout that being said there s been no hint that robinhood s bargain basement price structure will be changing so the new web based platform may still be a good option for those who are fee conscious and know how to do their research elsewhere pros collections analyst ratings check analysts buy hold and sell ratings for any ticker and read commentary from morningstar price paid seeing aggregate data for the average price paid for a given security as well as the current share price can help investors effectively time position entry people also bought each ticker profile will provide a list of stocks and etfs other investors frequently purchased to help users identify upstream suppliers competitors and more new features for the apps all features of the web based platform will be available in the ios and android apps later in cons no advertised advance tools though there may be surprise additions no advanced charting backtesting or analysis tools are currently planned for the web based platform no new securities based on published information the new platform won t offer options futures forex or mutual fund trading we still have to wait the primary downside to the web based platform is that it won t be out until see platform walkthrough mobile experience as robinhood s only current platform the mobile app experience is the linchpin of its product while the app available on ios and android doesn t have a lot of bells and whistles it is extremely intuitive aesthetically pleasing and user friendly as noted already you won t be able to do a lot of in depth research using the app but you can easily and quickly catch up on relevant news check streaming stock prices deposit or withdraw cash from your account and place trades all from your handheld device prosone of the primary advantages of the app is that it s simple to use even for beginning traders and the app setup is highly intuitive every process is clearly labeled and step by step instructions are offered for more complex operations like bank transfers when you first open the app or any time there is an update cards will pop up to explain how to use the app or where to find new features or to suggest handy shortcuts that make trading even simpler accessing help articles and customer support is also just one tap away and the app has all the same support resources as the website there s also no need to head to the website for any account maintenance as you can transfer money to or from your bank update your account settings and investment profile and change security requirements all right from the app you can even transfer stocks from another brokerage to your robinhood account or set up automated recurring bank transfers to ensure your account is always funded if you have touch id set up on your iphone the ios app automatically allows you to log in with your fingerprint once you ve registered your account a relatively minor feature that makes hopping in and out of the app quick and easy executing trades is incredibly simple you can either access the trade screen from a ticker profile or simply swipe left on a ticker in a watchlist to reveal a buy button swiping on a ticker will also reveal a delete button and you can remove a ticker from your watchlist by continuing to swipe left off screen consthe robinhood app s simplicity which may be a big benefit for casual traders or new investors could be a hindrance to more advanced investors and day traders it lacks almost all research and analysis tools meaning users need to have a pretty good idea of what they want to do before they open the app in addition robinhood doesn t provide any conditional ordering capabilities or advanced routing options so traders who utilize more advanced strategies or need to have a lot of in depth data available at a glance may need to weigh the relative benefits of robinhood s rock bottom prices against the convenience of trading on the same platform they use for research see platform walkthrough customer support robinhood offers multiple ways for users to get in touch as well as broker assisted trading for an additional fee however none of these resources are available so if you need support outside of market hours you ll be out of luck until the next business day twitteremail what you need to knowrobinhood does provide some social media support with a dedicated twitter handle for user questions there is also a facebook page though it is not as regularly updated as well as links to its google and linkedin profiles robinhood s support page also specifies that brokerage assistance may only be available for urgent requests so its one on one services are limited research insights the robinhood website has no research resources or tools again it is built for those who already know what they re doing or are only executing basic trade strategies since the platform only offers stock and etf trading there is no information about other securities like options or futures though the site does specify that the company hopes to add those trading capabilities in the future the mobile app however does offer some minimal research tools including a basic tick chart some at a glance fundamentals valuation statistics and a news feed newscurated stream of company economic and market news relevant to your portfolio and watchlist historical datatap and hold on the tick chart to see the closing price and change statisticseach ticker profile displays the stock s key figuresearningsticker profiles display earnings expectations and results for the past four quartersvolatilityeasy to interpret volatility indicator that reads high medium or low prosonce again the app s simplicity is its primary selling point all the data listed above is available on the ticker profile with no tabs or additional pages to click through just type in a ticker symbol or company name in the search bar and click the relevant result all data is displayed clearly in a scroll through format making a cursory analysis of any available security quick and easy consif you want to dive deeper into the numbers plot studies or indicators alongside tick data or use advanced tools like screeners this isn t the platform for you unless you want to do your research elsewhere and then use robinhood solely for placing trades if you re looking for conditional orders in depth fundamentals or searchable news and market updates robinhood will likely disappoint education the robinhood website also doesn t really provide anything in the way of educational resources except those that help the user experience the blog has additional information but only about robinhood features new developments and industry awards in terms of articles videos or other media that could help investors learn about stocks and other securities trading strategies or how to invest for specific goals like retirement the site comes up short faqssupport articleslearn more about the robinhood appsubmit requestcontact the support teamlacking educationno analyst musingsno advanced trading strategies to learn what you need to knowthe app offers the exact same collection of explanatory support articles as the site so those looking to read up on analyst musings or learn about advanced trading strategies won t find anything helpful the support section provides thorough and helpful articles on how to navigate the platform set up an account and use margin trading or other features but that s where the resource library s offerings end bottom line robinhood s founders took a look at the investment industry and found that the barrier for entry was simply too high for the average person by trimming the fat and ditching the brick and mortar storefronts and investment managers they ve created a platform that s within everyone s budget fulfilling their goal of democratizing the investment industry the tradeoff of course is that lowering overheads meant cutting the high tech features personal assistance and maintenance heavy educational resources and research tools that many investors have come to expect for investors who are happy to do their research and analysis elsewhere but are tired of trading commissions eating into their returns the free robinhood app is the cheapest most user friendly option around for investors just starting out the simple interface and intuitive design can make trading seem easy maybe even fun built in consumer protections also help inexperienced users avoid unnecessary risk and the danger of crashing and burning while the current apps are likely not a good fit for day traders or those who need a lot of data all in one place robinhood is still in its infancy with a web based platform rolling out next year and hints on the site regarding additional securities and new tools this everyman brokerage for the modern age may just be getting started reviewed by claire boyte white january claire has been writing about retirement planning tax
