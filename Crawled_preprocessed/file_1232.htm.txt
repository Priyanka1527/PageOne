width layout title h layout title h max width money it s something we all use every day but rarely think about except to lament that we don t have enough of it the u s has been making money since that first money was in the form of coins these early coins were made of precious metals and had actual value it wasn t until during the civil war that the department of treasury produced paper money which isn t actually paper it s cotton it was created to make up for the coin shortage since those early coins contained valuable metals americans began hording them as a hedge against the fluctuations in money created by the war see the history of money currency wars coins in your pocketmost of us use coins to purchase items from vending machines or we throw them in a bank to save for a rainy day but coins have a fascinating history did you ever wonder why the quarter has those ridges on the edge they were created to prevent counterfeiting yes even back in those gentler times of colonial america there were improvising criminals trying to counterfeit money these counterfeiters would shave the edges off of coins because they were made of silver and gold a ten dollar gold piece was made with ten dollars worth of gold to make a little extra money people would shave the edges of the coins and collect the metal if done well enough the smaller coins would not be noticed by merchants and they in effect would get less than ten dollars in gold for a purchase this gave the counterfeiter extra gold or silver to make into more coins today the ridges remain as a form of braille for the seeing impaired there are grooves on the edge of a quarter dollar billsthe dollar bill is the most circulated bill in the u s one dollar bills account for of the paper bills printed by the u s bureau of engraving and printing a dollar bill usually makes it through around months of use before it wears out if you take the time to look at the dollar bill you will notice a few things it s easy to notice the all seeing eye over the pyramid the eagle with arrows in its talons and the latin phrase e pluribus unum out of many one there are a few things however you might have missed such as other phrases on the bill annuit coeptis god or he providence has favored our undertakings novus ordo seclorum new order of the ages in god we trust this phrase actually first appeared on u s money between on a two cent coin it reappeared in and has been on all u s money since in the u s mint produced roughly one dollar bills if you have one million of them they would weigh pounds ask for s instead as one million of them would only weigh pounds as well you can make change for a one dollar bill ways penniespennies you either love them or hate them they were the first denomination of coins struck in the u s and they ve been around a long time they ve been around since when they were copper president lincoln made his appearance on the penny in modern pennies are made of a bit of copper with zinc and nickel there were million pennies produced in the current design of the penny still features president lincoln on the front but the reverse has gone through several revisions it now shows a union shield with vertical stripes a single horizontal bar across the top which represents the union and e pluribus unum there have been recurring attempts to stop production of the penny but for now it is still being produced see canada to remove the penny from circulationdead presidentsby legislation created during the revolutionary years of the u s no living person can be featured on a coin it was to ensure that the u s would not appear like a monarchy as living kings during the era were cast onto their countries coinage there has been one exception to this rule president calvin coolidge his image was struck on a commemorative coin that celebrated the sesquicentennial of american independence it was minted in women and minorities on moneyseveral women have appeared on u s coins the very first woman was actually not an american she was a spanish queen featured on a commemorative coin queen isabella of spain was the first lady to be cast on a u s coin in first lady martha washington however is the first woman to appear on circulated paper money she was featured on a silver certificate in and since then sacagawea susan b anthony and helen keller are the only other women to be featured on circulating money the first african american to appear was booker t washington his image was cast onto a memorial half dollar while there have been several african american treasurer s of the u s none have been featured on circulating currency local currencythe u s mint isn t the only place where money is produced there are several communities within the u s that actually produce their own money and you ve probably used some of it if you ve ever been to a walt disney theme park you have used disney money many colleges produce their own money for student use and even a few small communities like ithaca new york provide local cash this was created to provide more spending within the community at small businesses you exchange various amounts of u s cash for community dollars to make purchases with and those community dollars can increase in value million dollar billcontrary to a common belief the u s government has never issued a one million dollar bill the largest denomination ever printed was a series gold certificate this bill was used only in banking transactions and was never publicly circulated it featured the portrait of president woodrow wilson today the highest publicly circulating denomination of u s paper currency is the bill counterfeiting in the early years of the nation counterfeiting was a crime punishable by death benjamin franklin who also printed money for a short time actually put the phrase to counterfeit is death on his money counterfeiting was and is considered a threat to the economic stability of a nation early in the nation s history before the u s mint was established many colonies printed their own money foreign money was often used and much of it was easily counterfeited to combat this the u s mint and secret service were created the most counterfeited denomination of money is the bill followed by the in foreign countries the u s is the most frequently counterfeited as of the u s secret service reported foreign seizures totaling million in counterfeit u s currency and foreign passing totaling million in counterfeit u s currency coins are also still counterfeited although today they are most likely to be fakes of rare and valuable coins the u s bureau of engraving and printing celebrates the th anniversary of the u s bureau of engraving and printing as a part of the u s treasury department this bureau oversees the u s mints nationwide it prints million bills a day or million dollars this amount doesn t reflect new money ninety five percent of this is printed to replace currency already in circulation the u s dollar is the most widely used currency in international transactions all this printing requires tons of ink per day the paper and the ink currently used to print money is the exact same that was used during the civil war and is not paper but a cotton blend while this is very impressive the monopoly game actually prints more money annually nine engravers produce all the plates used to print money and all those plates are engraved in reverse the u s mint was the very first federal building built by the u s government and first struck coins in using a decimal system created by thomas jefferson the u s s largest mint is located in philadelphia and covers five acres the san francisco mint was one of the few buildings that survived that city s great earthquake of if the u s mint makes money a profit so does the entire country this profit is called seigniorage simply put if a quarter takes just a few cents to make but it s value is cents then it creates a profit that profit is then used to help fund the u s government dirty moneyaccording to several recent studies money in your wallet it is some really dirty stuff the older the bills the more contaminants that are present including salmonella and e coli bills that are printed on primarily cotton material were found to have the highest levels of bacteria where those created on newer slicker polymers had the least in a study conducted by the university of ballarat in australia scientists collected over banknotes from various countries worldwide the results of the study showed in the united states the cleanest dollars hosted just bugs which the researchers refer to as colony forming units or cfus the dirtiest greenbacks hosted which translates to about cfus per square centimeter most of the bacteria is completely harmless but there is always the possibility of a few very bad germs lurking on your money the best advice is to wash your hands after handling cash the bottom lineeach bill is
