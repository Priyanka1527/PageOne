property that costs between and times their gross income under this formula a person earning per year can afford a mortgage between and but this calculation is only a general guideline first it s a good idea to have an understanding of what your lender thinks you can afford to gain a precise idea of what size mortgage their clients can handle lenders use formulas that are much more complex and thorough second you need to determine some personal criteria by evaluating not only your finances but also your lifestyle preferences purchasing a four bedroom home with a pool may fulfill some of your goals and dreams however it could leave you house poor that is without enough money to maintain your too expensive house and pay for any other expenses as grim as that sounds many people choose to be house poor because they believe ultimately their income will increase as a result of raises and promotions making that expensive mortgage a smaller and smaller percentage of their monthly expenses in order to avoid being house poor consider the following issues before taking on a sizeable mortgage income when contemplating your ability to pay a mortgage ask yourself the following questions are you relying on two incomes just to pay the bills is your job stable could you easily find a job that would enable you to make payments if you lost your job lifestyle are you willing to change your lifestyle to get the house you want will you be able to realistically transform your lifestyle to save the money required to pay for an expensive mortgage risk tolerance regardless of your income will having a big mortgage keep you up at night mortgage lenders criteria from a bank s perspective your ability to purchase a home depends largely on the following factors front end ratio the front end ratio is the percentage of your yearly gross income dedicated toward paying your mortgage each month a good rule of thumb is that piti principal interest taxes and insurance should not exceed of your gross income however many lenders let borrowers exceed and some even let borrowers exceed back end ratio the back end ratio also known as the debt to income ratio dti calculates the percentage of your gross income required to cover your debts debts include your mortgage credit card payments child support and other loan payments most lenders recommend that your dti not exceed of your gross income to calculate your maximum monthly debt based on this ratio multiply your gross income by and divide by for example if you earn per year your maximum monthly debt expenses should not exceed down payment a down payment of at least of the purchase price of the home minimizes insurance requirements but many lenders let buyers purchase a home with significantly smaller down payments the down payment has a direct impact on your mortgage payment and therefore also on both the front end and back end ratios larger down payments enable buyers to purchase more expensive homes beyond the mortgage buying a new home is an exciting adventure but many prospective homeowners caught up in the thrill of searching for their dream house forget to pause and consider the financial responsibilities of homeownership while the mortgage is certainly the largest and most visible cost associated with a home there are a host of additional expenses some of which don t go away even after the mortgage is paid off smart shoppers would do well to keep the following items in mind maintenance even if you build a new home it won t stay new forever nor will those expensive major appliances like stoves dishwashers and refrigerators the same applies to the roof furnace driveway carpet and even the paint on the walls if you are house poor at your first mortgage payment you could find yourself in a difficult situation if your finances haven t improved by the time your home is in need of major repairs utilities heat light water sewage trash removal cable television and telephone services all cost money these expenses are not included in the front end ratio nor are they calculated in the back end ratio but these expenses are unavoidable for most homeowners association fees many homes in planned communities assess monthly or yearly association fees sometimes these fees are less than per year other times they are several hundred dollars per month ask about association fees prior to making a purchase find out about what the fee covers in some communities it includes lawn maintenance snow removal a community pool and other services in other communities the association fee covers little more than the administrative costs of hiring an attorney to encourage everyone in the neighborhood to maintain the exterior appearance of their homes while an increasing number of lenders include association fees in the front end ratio it pays to remember that these fees are likely to increase over time furniture and decor drive through almost any community of new homes after the sun goes down and you re likely to notice some interior lights illuminating big empty rooms which you can see only because those big beautiful houses don t have any window coverings this isn t the latest decorating trend it s the result of a family that spent all their money on the house and now can t afford curtains or furniture before you buy a new house take a good look around the number of rooms that will need to be furnished and the number of windows that will need to be covered basic mortgage terminology when talking to your mortgage broker it s important to know the terms he or she will use to describe your financial responsibility to the bank the following is the list of most important terms to understand before you sign on the dotted line principal this is the face value of your mortgage on day one and it represents the total amount of money you haven t repaid yet if your mortgage is on day one then your principal is a portion of each mortgage payment is dedicated to repayment of the principal loans are structured so that the amount of principal returned to the borrower starts out small and increases with each mortgage payment while the mortgage payments in the first years consist primarily of interest payments the payments in the final years consist primarily of principal repayment interest rate also known as apr this is how much interest accrues on your mortgage each year most times the calculator will ask you to enter this amount as a percentage and not a decimal unless otherwise specified for example if you have an interest rate of enter instead of the interest rate the lender s reward for taking on risk has a direct impact on the size of a mortgage payment if the interest rate on a mortgage is the combined principal and interest monthly payment on a year mortgage would be something like interest principal the same loan with a interest rate results in a monthly payment of mortgage length the number of payments and the amortization period it s assumed that if you re using a mortgage calculator you re using it before you take out your mortgage if that s the case these terms will be the same but if you re midway through paying down your mortgage you would want to find the number of payments by subtracting how many you ve made from the total expected number of payments to find how many more are remaining for example if you have a year mortgage months but just finished year two months then you would have payments remaining assuming your payments are monthly like most mortgages the amount paid per period and the amount of interest you pay the bank are both determined by the number of your payments more payments may mean each one is less in nominal dollars but it could also mean you re paying more in interest loan to value ratio this is a measure of the size of the mortgage compared to the home s value and is directly affected by the size of your down payment if you take out a mortgage on a home after making a down payment your loan to value ratio is private mortgage insurance pmi lenders will typically require you to buy pmi if your loan to value ratio is more than your down payment was less than of the purchase price and will continue to charge you this premium until it dips to homeowner s insurance often bundled with mortgage payments make sure you know your homeowner s insurance premium every month or at least make an educated guess if you don t know it yet adjustments if you ve taken out an adjustable rate mortgage adjustments are how many percentage points your interest rate increases decreases after a pre determined period taxes real estate taxes are assessed by governments and used to fund various public services such as school construction and police and fire department services taxes are calculated by the government on a per year basis but individuals can pay these taxes as part of their monthly payments the amount that is due in taxes is divided by the total number of monthly mortgage payments in a given year so borrowers should look at a past property tax bill or a property tax estimator for the area to know how much this might add to the bill the lender collects the payments and holds them in escrow until the taxes are due to be paid the bottom line buying a new home is an exciting adventure but many prospective homeowners caught up in the thrill of searching for their dream house forget to pause and consider the financial responsibilities of homeownership while the mortgage is certainly the largest and most visible cost associated with a home there are a host of additional expenses some of which don t go away even after the mortgage is paid off smart shoppers would do well to keep the following items in mind
