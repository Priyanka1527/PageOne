with periods of growth the economic cycle includes periods of decline which generally cause the most concern for investors but luckily there are strategies available to limit portfolio losses and even log some gains during a recession see also tutorial economics basics what is a recession a recession is an extended period of significant decline in economic activity in general economists refer to two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product gdp growth as a recession but other definitions exist recessions are characterized by faltering confidence on the part of consumers and businesses weakening employment falling real incomes and weakening sales and production not exactly the environment that would lead to higher stock prices or a sunny outlook on stocks as they relate to the market recessions tend to lead to heightened risk aversion on the part of investors and a subsequent flight to safety on the bright side however recessions predictably give way to recoveries sooner or later see also recession what does it mean to investors keep an eye on the horizon the key to investing before during and after a recession is to keep an eye on the big picture rather than trying to time your way in and out of various market sectors niches and individual stocks even though there s a lot of historical evidence for the cyclical nature of certain investments during recessions the fact of the matter is that timing such cycles is beyond the scope of the retail investor there s no need to be discouraged however because there are many ways that an ordinary person can invest to protect and profit during such economic cycles see also market cycles the key to maximum returns macroeconomics and capital markets first consider the macroeconomic aspects of a recession and how they affect capital markets when a recession hits companies slow down business investments consumers slow down their spending and people s perceptions shift from being optimistic and expecting a continuation of recent good times to becoming pessimistic and remaining uncertain about the future understandably during recessions investors tend to become frightened to worry about prospective investment returns and to scale back risk in their portfolios these psychological factors manifest themselves in a few broad capital market trends capital market trends during recessions within equity markets investors perceptions of heightened risk often lead them to require higher potential rates of return for holding equities for expected returns to go higher current prices need to drop which occurs as investors sell riskier holdings and move into safer securities such as government debt this is why equity markets tend to fall often precipitously prior to recessions as investors shift their investments investing by asset class history shows us that equity markets have an uncanny ability to serve as the leading indicator for recessions for example markets started a steep decline in mid before the recession of march to november but even in a decline there s good news for investors since pockets of relative outperformance can still be found in equity markets investing in stocks during a recession when investing in stocks during recessionary periods the relatively safest places to invest are in high quality companies that have long business histories because these should be the companies that can handle prolonged periods of weakness in the market for example companies with strong balance sheets including those with little debt and healthy cash flows tend to do much better than companies with significant operating leverage debt and weak cash flows a company with a strong balance sheet and cash flow is more able to handle an economic downturn and more likely to be able to fund its operations despite the tough economy by contrast a company with a lot of debt may be damaged if it can t handle its debt payments and the costs associated with its continuing operations see also what is a cash flow statement and breaking down the balance sheet but while a company s fiscal probity is important you still still have to make sure it s not cutting costs in the wrong areas a marketsense study of household brands performance during the recession showed that increased ad spending raised the sales of the following brands products jiff peanut butter kraft salad dressing bud light beer coors light beer pizza hut taco bell brands that neglected marketing on the other hand saw their sales drop steeply these brands included but were not limited to jell o hellman s doritos green giant mcdonald s historically one of the safer places in the equity market is consumer staples these are typically the last products that a household removes from its budget by contrast electronic retailers and other consumer discretionary companies can suffer as consumers put off higher end purchases see also cyclical versus non cyclical stocks danger and diversification that said it s dangerous to pile into a single sector including consumer staples diversification is especially important during a recession when particular companies and industries can get hammered diversifying across asset classes such as fixed income and commodities in addition to equities can also act as a check on portfolio losses investing in fixed income in a recession fixed income markets are no exception to the general risk aversion of recessionary environments investors tend to shy away from credit risk which means that corporate bonds especially high yield bonds and mortgage backed securities since these investments have higher default rates than government securities as the economy weakens businesses have a more difficult time generating revenue and profits which can make debt repayment difficult and in the worst case scenario lead to bankruptcy as investors sell these risky assets they seek safety and move into u s treasury bonds in other words the prices of risky bonds go down as people sell meaning the yields on these bonds increase the prices of treasury bonds go up meaning their yields decrease see also what are the risks of investing in a bond investing in commodities during a recession another area of investment to consider during a recession is commodities growing economies need inputs including natural resources these needs grow as economic output does pushing up the prices for such resources conversely as economies slow demand slows and commodity prices tend to drop if investors believe a recession is coming they ll often sell commodities which drives prices lower since commodities are traded on a global basis however a recession in the u s will not necessarily have a large direct impact on commodity prices investing during a recovery what about when the economy begins to recover just as in a downturn during a recover you have to keep an eye on macroeconomic factors one of the tools the government uses most frequently to reduce the impact of a recession is easy monetary policy reducing interest rates in order to increase the money supply discourage people from saving and encourage spending the overall purpose here remember is ultimately to increase economic activity one of the side effects of low interest rates is increased demand for higher risk higher return investments as a result equity markets tend to do very well during economic recoveries some of the best performing stocks use operating leverage as part of their ongoing business activities especially as these are often beat up during a downturn and become undervalued leverage may also hurt during a recession but it works well during good times allowing firms that take on debt to grow faster than companies that don t growth stocks and small cap stocks also tend to do well during economic recoveries as investors embrace risk see also operating leverage captures relationships fixed income and commodity markets similarly within fixed income markets increased demand for risk manifests itself in higher demand for credit risk making corporate debt of all grades and mortgage backed debt more attractive prices go up and yields go down on the other hand investors tend to shift out of u s treasuries pulling prices down while pusing yields up the same logic holds for commodity markets in that faster economic growth increases demand which drives prices for raw materials remember however that commodities are traded on a global basis the u s economy isn t the sole driver of demand for these resources the bottom line when recessions strike it s best to focus on the long term horizon and manage your exposures minimizing the risk in your portfolio and setting aside capital to invest during the recovery of course you re never going to time the beginning or end of a recession to the day but anticipating a recession isn t as hard as you might think all that s necessary is to have the discipline to ignore the crowd shift away from risky investments during times of extreme optimism wait out the oncoming storm and embrace risk when others are shying away from it see also the greatest market crashes trending a stock sell off vocabulary
