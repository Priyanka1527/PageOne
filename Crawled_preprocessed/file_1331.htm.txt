past and since that time you have elected to steer clear of that same conversation after all by the numbers he or she is correct but it still doesn t help you sleep better at night paying down debt early is often a battle of the mind i too have found myself preaching that debt can be good i have reminded my clients that if you can earn a higher return on your investments than the interest rate you are being charged for borrowing it makes sense to pay the debt down according to its schedule and keep the investments working for you but i am human too and i cannot wait to pay off my home loan and car loan for related reading see paying down debt vs investing a strategy to pay it down let s face it we don t like the idea of owing someone else money we want to remove the burden of being bothered just knowing that another monthly invoice is being mailed to my home makes me squirm however having cheap debt can be good thing specifically right now in a low interest rate environment here is an example of a strategy for those of us who want to pay down our debt quicker than scheduled without completely derailing our future retirement goals i say completely because it is a strategy that prevents you from paying off the entire debt in one fell swoop which could destroy your goal of retirement but also allows you to pay the debt off earlier with more frequent additional payments of course you should consult your financial advisor and accountant to review the investment and tax consequences before moving forward with this strategy it is the beginning of a new year you owe on your home and based on the amortization schedule you will have the mortgage paid off three years after retirement you have approximately invested in a taxable account earning an annualized return of over

strategy is skimming off the top what i mean by that is taking withdrawals from your investment account in a tax efficient manner when the market has gains for the year with this strategy you would most likely create capital gains from the sale of the assets which could be taxed at or depending on your income your financial advisor would probably recommend selling assets that are overweight based on your investment allocation or assets that are at a loss for tax loss harvesting purposes in the years that the market is up distribute a portion of the gains from the investment account and apply that to pay off your mortgage for example if you earn in gains for the year take the entire amount or a portion and apply it to your mortgage on top of your regular payments if you create additional taxes due from the sale of the assets put some of the cash aside when the market is down stop the strategy so that you are not selling assets at a loss at this time you want to ride the market out and continue to make your regular mortgage payments from your regular cash flow although this strategy can go against many financial advisors recommendations it does help achieve goals and reduce the internal stress that comes with having debt just remember that when you pull money from your investments to pay down debt you risk the opportunity for growth on those dollars you also lose out on the tax deduction from the larger amount of interest you would have paid if you can sleep better at night with a potentially smaller investment account knowing that your mortgage will be paid off in a shorter amount of time then that should make you feel good about the decision for related reading see should parents save towards college or retirement monette ryan rockford ilwww
