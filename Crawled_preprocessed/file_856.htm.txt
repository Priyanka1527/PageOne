experience fidelity packs a lot of features even into its most basic web based set up including extensive screening capabilities and a research and an online learning center that is second to none the more advanced active trader pro system also works seamlessly with both macs and pcs though you can download a specialized software version if you prefer prosdesigners have packed a ton of information into the basic web version but the overall experience is still intuitive and easy to learn the web search engine is easy to use and effective consfor full web functionality you must meet a trade minimum in a rolling month period fidelity s focus is narrower than that of some other online brokers it doesn t support futures or forex trading also other than the demo mode for its software not available on macs fidelity doesn t directly offer a paper trading solution for users looking for a dry run before committing to a strategy and some research companies such as recognia are available only to very active traders recognia for example is available only to those who have logged at least trades over the past year on a rolling basis see platform walkthrough mobile experience fidelity s

trading platforms typically a dozen or more reports are available for larger stocks and many sectors and indexes the advanced solutions especially wealth lab pro also provide years of market data so traders can backtest strategies before committing real money consfidelity s research is limited to the products and asset classes that it sells so you won t find much research specifically on forex or futures contracts which it doesn t support also although fidelity offers third party research from over different firms in addition to research from its own deep bench of analysts some of that research such as recognia is not available unless the customer meets certain activity criteria education fidelity is friendly to the novice trader with hundreds of free educational articles tutorials and videos on dozens of different topics topics include stock and option trading retirement funds college saving tax planning debt and budgeting charitable giving estate tax planning life insurance

a great place for mutual fund fans thanks to the extensive selection of no transaction fee fidelity funds and other funds and etfs while fidelity is primarily an active management shop its index funds and etfs are competitively priced and its solid trade execution makes investor costs effectively even lower that should appeal to cost sensitive investors and indexing fans fidelity ties it all together with a solid cash management program that qualifies for fdic insurance and sweetens the deal by providing limited banking services such as atm access and credit and debit cards those who want to trade forex or futures contracts however must look elsewhere fidelity does not support these activities while fidelity does have some good functionality for chart watchers especially on its
