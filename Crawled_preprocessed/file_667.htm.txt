could be â donâ t judge a stock by its share price â despite muchâ readily availableâ information for investors many people still incorrectly assume that a stock with a small dollar price is cheap while another with a heftier price is expensive thisâ notion can lead investors down the wrong path and into some bad decisions for their money the cheapest stocks â which are known as â penny stocksâ â also tend to be the riskiest a stock that just went from to might end up at zero while a stock that goes from to might double again to looking at a stockâ s share price is only useful when taking many other factors into account the factors to consider investors often make the mistake of looking only at stock price because it is often the most visibly quoted number in the financial press however the actual dollar price of a stock means very little unless many other factors are considered for example if company a has a billion market capitalization and has billion shares while company b has a billion market capitalization and million shares both companies will have a share price of but company a is worth times more than company b a stock with a share price may seem very expensive to some retail investors they might think that a triple digit share price is badâ andâ feel that a stock has a better chance of doubling than a stock this is a misguided viewâ because the stock might be considerably overvalued and the stock could be undervalued the opposite also could be true as well but share price alone is no sign of value market capitalization is a clearer indication of how the company is valued and gives a better idea of the stockâ s value understanding market capitalization and share price stocks are divided up into shares to provide clearly distinguishable units of a company so that investors can buy a portion of the company corresponding to a portion of the total shares the actual number of shares outstanding for publicly listed companies can vary widely one way in which companies controlâ the number of available shares and how investors feel about their share price is throughâ stock splits and reverse stock splits there are some psychological associations with stock prices and companies will sometimes choose to cater to this investor psychology through stock splits for example people tend to prefer buying stocks in round lots of shares this leads to the conclusion that a stock with a share price of more than may turn off the average investorâ because it requires a cash outlay of at least to buy shares this is a large financial commitment to make to one stock for the average retail investor as a result a company that has had a good run and has seen its shares rise from to might choose to do a two for one stock split how stock splits work a two for one split means that the company will change every single share of stock into two it also means that the value of each share will be divided in half so that the two new shares will be exactly equal to the one old share an investor might be more comfortable buying the shares at making a investment to purchase shares when looking at the actual transaction though the real numbers aren t any different than before when the investor buys the stock after the split shares constitute a investment however the investor could just as easily have bought shares before the split made the same investment and had the same percentage ownership in the same company this is why market capitalization is important the companyâ s market cap will not change due to the split so if a investment means a ownership in the company before the split it will mean the same afterward and reverse splits a reverse split is just the opposite and it comes with its own psychology â â some investors think that stocks that are less than are riskier than stocks with double digit share prices if a companyâ s share price drops to it can counter this perception by doing a one for two reverse stock split in this case the company will convert every two shares of stock outstanding into one share worth x the principles are the same this can be done in any combination â three for one one for five etc â but the point is that this does not add any true value to the stock and it does not make an investment in the company more or less risky all it does is change the share price a real world example berkshire hathaway vs microsoft an example of where a high price may have made investors pause is warren buffettâ s berkshire hathaway in a share of berkshire hathaway sold for the triple digit share price would have made many investors think twice however berkshire class a shares are worth each as of feb the stock rose to those heights because the company and buffett created shareholder value at per share would you consider the stock expensive the answer to that question does not depend on the dollar price of the shares another example of a stock that has generated exceptional shareholder value is microsoft the companyâ s shares have split multiple times since its initial public offering in march microsoft closed at on its first day of trading and is valued at per share as of feb that seems like a decent return over years but when all the splits are accounted for a investment in would be worth significantly more today because the stock did split each share would also represent a much smaller piece of the company microsoft and berkshire both produced stellar returns for investors but the former decided to split several times while the latter did not does this make one more expensive than the other now no if either should be considered expensive or cheap it should be based on the underlying fundamentals not the share prices when does price matter share price can have a big impact on a company there are the psychological implications to the market mentioned above but there are also real implications that can affect a businessâ solvency companies can raise cash through equity or debt the weighted average cost of capital wacc is a weighted average of a companyâ s cost of debt and cost of equity if a companyâ s share price plummets its cost of equity rises also causing its wacc to rise a dramatic spike in cost of capital can cause a business to shut its doors especially capital dependent businesses such as banks this problem should always be on the minds of investors following a sharp stock decline the bottom line some investors may focus on share price when looking at a stockâ because it is the most visible number in the financial press investors should not get fixated on share price alone â companies can change them dramatically through stock splits reverse splits and stock dividends withoutâ changing fundamentals dig a little deeper when thinking about a potential investment remember that a stock with a high price can go much higher under the right circumstances just as a stock with a low price can sink even further if it
