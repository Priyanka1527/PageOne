want to invest in a bond and your banker shows you two issued by the same company and that have exactly the same credit risk they both mature five years from now one is trading at per share and provides a coupon while the other trades at and provides a coupon you look at each bond s yield to maturity ytm percentage and see the two are fairly close your banker suggests you buy bond a because it offers the slightly higher ytm see table you have heard about another measure for evaluating bonds with different coupon rates called duration but you are not sure what it means and whether you should consider it in making this investment selection you decide to consult with your financial planner why the yield to maturity metric is insufficient your planner confirms for you that ytm while an often used metric is an incomplete and insufficient measure for your decision making she explains it is calculated under the implicit assumption that the interest income coupons you will receive can be reinvested at the same ytm rate throughout the entire life of the bond since current short term interest rates are well below the ytm of both bonds their realized return is likely to be below the promised ytm of and using the current short term interest rate of your planner calculates an expected realized return for both bonds based on their coupon payments being reinvested at the rate under these conditions she shows that bond b would produce an annualized return of while bond a would result in an annualized return of a full basis points lower your planner explains this difference between the ytm and the realized return for the bonds is due to their differing sensitivities to interest rate changes to demonstrate more clearly she introduces a zero coupon bond from the same company bond c it matures in years and trades at see table use duration to determine bond s sensitivity to interest rates the interest rate sensitivity columns in table show how the value of each of the bonds is affected if market interest rates rise or fall by basis points you can see that the zero coupon bond behaves more like bond b than bond a when interest rates change this information about sensitivity to interest rates is communicated through the bond s duration or modified duration metric as shown in table bond c and bond b have the same duration therefore their values shift similarly for any given change in interest rates for related reading see use duration and convexity to measure bond risk duration is simply defined as the time weighted average of a stream of cash flows as such it measures the sensitivity of the bond s present value or price to changes in interest rates a higher duration means a greater sensitivity to interest rate changes a lower duration means less sensitivity therefore when choosing between bonds with different coupon rates we should be more concerned with their duration than with their respective maturities in the example above you will certainly favor bond b over bond c same duration but higher yield bond a is more difficult to compare because its duration is different clearly you will choose it instead of b or c if you expect an interest rate increase it experiences less of a drop in price for any given increase in yield however if interest rates fall because of that same lower sensitivity a will rise in value less than b or c to properly evaluate bond a you have to compare it to other bonds with the same duration for related reading see common bond buying mistakes this article might contain forward looking statements
