assets forex traders pay both a spread and a commission while saxo bank does not provide the lowest commissions in the industry it does provide competitive commissions for those trading larger monthly volumes there is a spread and minimum commission for single stocks but no maximum commission this can get expensive if you trade a lot of single stocks there are no charges for normal withdrawals or terminating an account inactivity fees only kick in after an account has been idle for six months or more eur usd pips gbp usd pips usd jpy pips or pips commission dma s p cfd japan oil cfd us y t note gold us stocks spread cents share minimum spreads can vary based on volatility trust if there s one area where saxo bank suffered slightly in our ratings it was with trust it s worth noting however that the reason for this was the company s lack of compensation above and beyond what s required by regulators in the event of a default by saxo bank however while saxo bank does not provide additional deposit insurance it does take steps to ensure client funds are not comingled with corporate funds ensuring that client money and assets are protected in the unlikely event that saxo bank becomes insolvent by holding those funds in segregated accounts at regulated banks the firm is registered with the financial conduct authority in the uk which provides good transparency and industry standard deposit protection gbp default insurance if saxo bank defaults any shortfall of funds of up to gbp may be compensated for under the financial services compensation scheme fscs gbp default insurance failed bank if the custodian bank holding client funds goes into liquidation any shortfall of funds of up to gbp may be compensated for under the financial services compensation scheme fscs what you need to knowsaxo bank is regulated by the financial conduct authority fca and follows the strict regulatory requirements known as the client money and client assets rules found in the client assets sourcebook cass outlined by the fca the bank holds client funds in segregated bank accounts with the client as beneficiary special features saxo bank provides most of its special features through its openapi plugin for excel excel is a compelling platform because of its flexibility you can write commands to execute trades backtest a trading strategy or simply monitor the positions in your account without having to learn a new coding language the one drawback for clients is saxo bank does not provide access to virtual private servers vps on which to run the programs traders often use a vps to run automated trading algorithms in the background even when their own home or office computers may not be running for those not interested in creating their own trading strategies in excel the broker offers prebuilt professionally managed saxoselect trading strategies that clients can monitor and even invest in develop implement trading strategiesdesign your algorithm in excel

managers in saxoselect trading strategies what you need to knowsaxo bank provides impressive flexibility when it comes to trade management and strategy development for traders acquainted with the advanced functionality of microsoft excel saxo bank s openapi for excel provides a stable platform on which they can build desktop experience we found saxo bank s saxotradergo a browser based trading platform to be stable comprehensive and fully customizable it provides everything from news alerts and third party trading signals to watchlists and dynamic charts a vast amount of information can be applied to the charts in our review even when indicators drawings economic events and more were added to the charts they still had a clean organized layout the charts also did well when toggling between chart time frames and launching charts in new windows traders who are accustomed to executing trades on the mt platform may be disappointed to learn saxo bank does not offer an mt option proseverything in the online trading platform is customizable from the color of the platform to the positioning and number of charting news and portfolio windows customers can place trades for forex cfds equities bonds and options all within the same platform we found the offerings within the platform to be relatively broad integrated trading signals from autochartist news updates from newsedge and ransquawk and in house analysis and trade opinions from the team at tradingfloor com all help keep traders engaged and informed conssaxo bank does not offer the mt trading platform it also does not allow third party trading platforms outside of the company s own openapi for excel to connect with the trading platform this limits the number of additional tools clients can use in their trading see platform walkthrough mobile experience the saxo bank saxotradergo mobile app includes all of the functionality available in the desktop application traders can access all of saxo bank s trading instruments account details trading signals and charting complete with trading indicators and drawing tools from both the android and iphone apps clients can also access the latest trade and economic research from tradingfloor com both the iphone app and the android app include fingerprint security a feature we have found to be surprisingly rare in this space enabling you to unlock the trading platform without typing in your username and password prosthe mobile application includes all of the same functionality clients can use in the desktop version to analyze and research trading opportunities clients can use customizable watch lists track their accounts and receive trading alerts the dynamic charts can be expanded to full screen to provide better clarity during the technical analysis process clients can also access tradingfloor com s research or deposit or withdraw cash into or from their accounts consalthough both the iphone and android apps include fingerprint security there is otherwise no added security beyond the login password we would like to see the app include customizable automatic sign out and verification of login from another device see platform walkthrough customer support saxo bank maintains a robust faq database support centre where clients can find answers to commonly asked questions quickly without having to wait for in person support prospective clients can also call and talk to a sales representative about their questions saxo bank s customer support score suffered slightly because prospective clients don t have access to live chat which is only located within the live trading platform not the demo platform only premium and platinum clients have access to chat in their preferred language walk in support is not available for saxo clients live chatemail what you need to knowcustomer service is available hours a day days per week for customers who have funded their accounts saxo bank also offers chat support in more than languages for those who meet the minimum account funding threshold of k to become a premium account holder the support centre faq covers a wide variety of topics and has an excellent search engine if you do not have a live account your customer support options are limited to the faq and to calling a sales representative research insights saxo bank scored well in our research category because of its robust offerings available through tradingfloor com coupled with its real time news feeds calendars and advanced data analytics these research features are available in saxotradergo s web based

weekly commitment of traders cot report prossaxo bank provides a wide range of analytics research and tools we especially liked the analysis provided by the saxostrats team the fx open orders and fx open positions tools provides useful sentiment information the economic calendar was easy to use integrated into the trading platform and included expectations actual results currencies affected and historical data consif we saw one drawback to the impressive amount of analysis provided on tradingfloor com it s that there s no way to automate trades in an account based on the information provided this is a service that would be especially useful for the community of traders product education saxo bank provides client education via its saxo academy the academy is well organized and comprehensive covering forex cfds equities options futures and bonds the courses and the ongoing webinars and commentary incorporate the saxotradergo trading platform which will help investors to

markets the ability to track progress through the courses helps traders stay focused and develop a pathway through the material that makes sense bottom line saxo bank scored well in most areas of our analysis the broker offers a proprietary professional grade trading platform that we felt would appeal to both new and experienced traders alike new traders will find the tools and educational opportunities necessary to get started seasoned traders will appreciate the flexible customizable trading platform the firm offers access to a broad product line including forex cfds equities futures and bonds we would have preferred at least the option as a prospective client to chat with a live representative but otherwise their customer support was professional and courteous the firm s
