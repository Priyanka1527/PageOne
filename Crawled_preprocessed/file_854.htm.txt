with a vengeance and as a result so is tax loss harvesting while many think this tax smart strategy is only a fourth quarter move with stocks whipsawing between up and down days throughout the year charles schwab s david koenig chief investment strategist for schwab intelligent portfolios said there are lots of opportunities to pair winning stocks with losing ones to offset capital gains outside of the end of the year it s really designed to take advantage of the natural volatility in the market throughout the year said koenig in an interview with investopedia in when volatility was low and stocks were setting new highs seemingly every month there were fewer opportunities to engage in tax loss harvesting but with volatility rising in the ability to implement this tax savings strategy has increased in early february around the time of the correction the number of tax loss harvesting trades made for clients jumped significantly said koenig that said we also had tax loss harvesting trades for clients in and every month since periods of higher volatility present more opportunity check out investopedia s td ameritrade review to learn about this low cost broker with powerful charting tools when it comes to tax loss harvesting there are rules that investors have to be aware of such as the wash sale rule under internal revenue service guidelines investors can t claim a tax loss on a stock they sold and then repurchased within days the irs looks at all of the investor s holdings to determine if he or she broke the rule and if it finds that one stock sale purchase did so it will be disallowed furthermore while it can be easy to spot winners and losers in stock portfolios it can get tougher to identify those opportunities for etf investors to aid in that and to prevent clients from running afoul of the wash sale rule the schwab intelligent portfolio will do the work for clients using algorithms that automatically check every portfolio each day for rebalancing and tax loss harvesting opportunities take a large cap u s stock exchange traded fund etf as an example if that etf has a big enough decline it will be sold off to offset any capital gains for the year to prevent the client from losing exposure to large cap u s stocks during the days that the irs doesn t allow repurchase of that same etf schwab intelligent portfolio will invest in another etf that gives the client the same exposure but doesn t run afoul of the wash sale rules it s a great feature for taxable account clients said the executive from the charles schwab corporation schw it s a strategy that hasn t been readily available to individual investors in the past latest news monthly mortgage payments could increase by year end record yoy fee decline in driven by vanguard discount
