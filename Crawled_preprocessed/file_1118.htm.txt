experience mobile experience customer support research insights education return to broker center products fees trust desktop experience mobile experience customer support research insights education cmc markets fast facts cmc markets has nearly years of experience in the forex and cfd business the company has a comprehensive product line including forex pairs and commodity index and single stock cfds the company is regulated in the uk by the financial services authority fsa and is publicly listed on the london stock exchange spreads and trading costs are better than average and the trading platform and research tools are good however traders familiar with platforms like metatrader and automated expert advisors will find those missing with cmc markets fee based guaranteed stop loss orders and binary options are somewhat unique in the industry and may be an advantage to many traders pros breadth of trading products cmc markets offers forex pairs indexes shares and etfs and bond and commodity products risk management guaranteed stop loss orders are available for a fee providing increased protection against volatile markets robust trading platform although proprietary the trading platform is feature rich with excellent charts tools order entry and social based analysis cons no automated trading metatrader expert advisors backtesting and vps are unavailable with cmc markets cryptocurrencies are missing there is no bitcoin or other cryptocurrency trading available commissions for single stocks there is a minimum commission for single stock trades but no maximum commission cfd instruments years of experience spread betting instruments products fees cmc markets has below average spreads for the largest forex pairs indexes and commodity cfds there is a spread and minimum commission for single stocks but no maximum commission which can get expensive for large traders the spreads aren t fixed and will vary with market liquidity investors can use guaranteed stop loss orders for a fee that will protect them from market volatility but only a portion of that fee will be refunded if the trade closes at a price other than the stop loss or the stop is cancelled there are no charges for normal withdrawals and an inactivity fee only kicks in after an account has been idle for two years eur usd pips gbp usd pips usd jpy pips s p cfd japan oil cfd us y t note gold us stocks spread not fixed spreads u s shares trades have minimum commission of spread share commission trust cmc markets trust scores suffered slightly in our ratings because of the lack of account protection above and beyond what s required by uk regulators also traders cannot use custodian banks to hold their capital and it is possible to lose more than you have deposited unless you pay a fee for guaranteed stop loss protection gbp default insurance cmc markets if cmc defaults up to gbp under the financial services compensation scheme fscs gbp default insurance failed bank if the custodian bank holding client funds goes into liquidation what you need to knowaccount funds are held by cmc markets in the uk which is subject to regulation by the financial conduct authority the amount of protection for each account in the event of default is limited the funds are held in segregated accounts with uk banks including barclays lloyds and hsbc or outside the uk in banks like deutsche bank and ulster bank special features we rated cmc markets low for special features because the broker does not offer any backtesting auto trading or shadow trading functionality however it is worth noting that cmc markets still offers an impressive array of other types of trading tools mostly accessed through its proprietary trading platform that are worth a second look tools based education including youtube videos are better than average and organized well some unique features include the ability to not only view what other clients are trading in the aggregate but also what cmc markets top clients are trading we especially liked the ability to share and view chart analysis between cmc markets account holders fairly standard pattern recognition and advanced charting tools are also available cmc markets offers two variations of binary options as well which may be interesting to some investors but the spread was very expensive social chartingdisplay other traders chart annotations in your own platformtrack client sentimentsee what other top clients are trading and get new ideasbinary optionsestimate where the price will be at a specific time in the future what you need to knowcmc markets analysis tools are focused on allowing traders to find new opportunities and streamline their analysis the trading platform does not include the ability to preprogram trading strategies backtest or install expert advisors but the tools they do have should still allow traders the features we highlighted won t require programming skill but the learning curve could be steep for new traders fortunately cmc has good education and videos to help investors leverage the platform desktop experience cmc markets next generation trading platform is browser based and supports complex order types and account analytics the platform includes customizable charts advanced studies templates customizable display styles clients can trade directly from the charts and research and analysis tools including screeners market calendar and social charting are integrated into the platform the trading platform rating was hit slightly by the fact that there isn t an mt alternative or trade analytics functionality prosthe navigation was unique but easy to use with familiar menus traders can enter complex order types including buy sell and trailing stops from watchlist style menus or directly from the chart position sizes are customizable and defaults were easy to set the charts were easy to use and included advanced functionality and indicators integrated research screeners social charting news and calendars were one of the best benefits of the platform consthere is no autotrading expert advisors or backtesting functionality the platform is easy to use but it is adobe flash based which may cause technical issues for some users as many modern browsers and operating systems no longer install flash by default because the platform is flash there are no right click menus which can also throw some users off see platform walkthrough mobile experience the cfd trading mobile app includes most of the functionality available in the desktop application traders can access cmc markets trading instruments complex order types and account details screeners and charting from the android or iphone apps the app has a customizable layout so that a client s default opening screen can be focused on the information they want to see first the iphone app includes fingerprint security but the android version does not prosthe mobile app includes all the functionality to analyze and research trading opportunities clients can use advanced order types and track their accounts the same way they would in the desktop app the filtering and searching tools will help investors navigate to the products they are interested in without getting lost in the smaller screen format a customizable home screen is also helpful for traders who use their mobile app for specific purposes consalthough the app includes fingerprint security in the iphone version there is otherwise no added security beyond the login password we would like to see the app include customizable automatic sign out and verification of login from another device although the app was full featured the text and design was very dense and could be difficult for some clients to navigate on smaller mobile screens see platform walkthrough customer support cmc markets customer support is available whenever the markets are open via phone chat and email during our tests we found that support was relatively quick to respond and we didn t have to wait more than or minutes for a chat request and phone calls to be answered if you prefer chat based support the feature is most easily accessible from the desktop trading application online helpemail what you need to knowwe found cmc markets representatives to be courteous and knowledgeable the chat function in the trading platform was very easy to use and helpful and phone support was very fast to pick up a call the support website also has a good knowledge base and searchable archive that should answer most questions about the trading platforms and order types some of the material was a little old but for the most part self help support was easy to find and use research insights cmc markets scored very well in the research category the platform includes real time news feeds calendars and advanced data analytics a feed of cmc markets own internal analysis throughout the day included links to commentary analysis trading ideas and webinars the addition of morningstar s stock reports is a unique offering for live accounts the amount and quality of the research resources are above average analyst insightsa feed of market

chart analysis of other traders on your platformcmc tvdaily youtube videos of market commentary and platform educationreuters news feedsreal time updates and announcements of the global markets proscmc markets provides a very wide range of analytics research and tools we liked the client sentiment tool and pattern screeners the economic calendar was easy to use integrated into the trading platform and included expectations actual results currencies affected and historical data research from cmc markets analysts was good and will help investors understand the market and the proprietary trading platform consthe commitment of traders report was missing from cmc markets research tools while we liked the fact that many of the research tools were available on the mobile app the text may be too small and dense for some users education cmc markets education was well organized and comprehensive the ongoing webinars and commentary used the trading platform which will help investors to become more proficient with its use many of the educational videos were available on youtube which will be convenient for mobile use and accessibility short courses on cfds forex stocks spread betting and stocks were good and covered the basics our biggest complaint was the minimal amount of education available for more advanced traders learn where to startgetting started articles and videos education for investors about forex cfds stocks spread betting and binary options what s happening nowtrading webinars and market commentary commentary in the live market to help you plan for the week apply technical analysisstrategy education videos an analyst explains general concepts behind developing a trading strategy what you need to knowthe education offered by cmc markets was good and easy to navigate many of the videos can be accessed on youtube or directly on cmc markets website the education is mostly focused on introductory content to get a trader familiar with the trading platform and the core concepts of trading forex cfds stocks and spread betting there wasn t a great deal of advanced education however the ongoing webinars and market commentary can partially fill that gap bottom line besides being subject to the uk s financial services authority cmc markets is also publicly traded which adds another layer of transparency for clients the proprietary trading platform doesn t include auto trading expert advisors or backtesting but is still relatively robust compared to the rest of the industry although cmc markets doesn t offer cryptocurrency trading there are over stocks and funds forex pairs and more than indexes and commodities trading costs are lower than average and customer service was quick to respond and available during all market hours cmc markets also offers two types of binary options which may be interesting for some traders but had a very expensive spread reviewed by john jagerson january john jagerson has worked in the capital markets and
