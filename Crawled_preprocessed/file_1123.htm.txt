products fees trust special features desktop experience mobile experience customer support research insights education forex com gain capital fast facts owned by the publicly traded gain capital nyse gcap forex com provides forex index commodities shares and bitcoin markets to traders around the world forex com offers more than one excellent trading platform including the industry standard metatrader and plenty of research tools while forex com s education wasn t comprehensive it was good enough to get new investors familiar with the market quickly for traders with a large account balance trades can be executed on an ecn with greater market transparency the company is regulated in the uk by the financial conduct authority fca pros trading markets forex com offers access to forex shares bonds indices and commodity cfds choice of trading platforms custom web and client trading platforms as well as mt webinars and education good support for understanding the market and trading platforms cons guaranteed stops are limited guaranteed stops may be available for a fee on some markets average forex and shares trading costs the spread for the most popular forex pairs and shares were merely average compared to others in the industry difficult to navigate education despite a large quantity navigating the educational articles videos and webinars will be tricky forex pairs shares offered stock indices commodity cfds products fees forex com has average spreads for some of the largest forex pairs and shares but below average costs for index and commodity cfds we were pleased to see an offering for bitcoin but additional cryptocurrencies are not yet traded at the broker account fees were limited and below average but there is a nominal minimum account balance required to open an account eur usd pips gbp usd pips usd jpy pips s p cfd japan oil cfd btc usd eu stocks not fixed spreads trust while forex com s trust scores suffered in our ratings because of the lack of account protection above and beyond what s required by uk regulators this was not unusual among our various reviews they also suffered a bit due to their internet encryption technology which is just average while it s nice that forex com offers guaranteed stop losses for a fee there is no negative balance protection it was also difficult for us to determine which markets had guaranteed stop losses available and at what cost we do know that they are not always available on every market which limits the usefulness of that order type the broker is regulated in the u k by the fca which provides some protection in the event forex com or the bank becomes insolvent the broker also accepts clients from the u s up to gbp in the event of forex com s default possible compensation from fca s financial services compensation scheme fscf for investment losses up to gbp in the event of the bank s default for uk accounts what you need to knowaccount funds are held by forex com in the uk which is subject to regulation by the financial conduct authority fca the amount of protection for each account in the event of default is limited account holders cannot use a separate custodial account to increase their protection special features forex com provides most of the special features we find elsewhere in the industry by offering the metatrader mt platform however we liked that the broker s client and web apps are also extremely robust with excellent research and technical tools backtesting and autotrading are available through both the broker s custom application as well as mt besides the platform tools forex com has a good selection of fundamental and technical research resources as well live trading sessionswebinars with market analysis live trading ideas and q atradingview multichartsrobust advanced charting with trade from the charts functionalityexpert advisorsclient application and mt support autotrading and backtesting of eas what you need to knowunlike many brokers forex com s advantage trader application was very good and had some features that were better than mt the advanced charting from tradingview multicharts in the web trading application are very robust and included trade from the chart functionality the calendar and other economic analysis resources were fine but a little average in functionality and detail the webinar programming was interesting and included actionable ideas which is somewhat unusual in the industry desktop experience clients can use the custom advantage trader platform from forex com a web application featuring tradingview charts or they can use the popular mt client and mobile apps to access the markets advantage trader also has a mobile app that we found comparable to mt s all the applications included advanced charting studies watchlists and trade automation through expert advisor plugins or other autotrading functionality that many traders appreciate the platforms had standard menus and easy to access advanced features the look and feel of the web application was very modern and functional while the other client apps were a little dated we found some of the client app chart functions to be a bit clunky prosthere is plenty of flexibility offered when choosing a trading application clients are sure to find one that fits their unique needs investors more familiar with mt will feel right at home although the advantage trader custom app had a very similar look and feel the web application had the best charts in our opinion but hedging guaranteed stop losses and if then oco orders were only available on the custom advantage trader platform consnot all markets were available in each of the platforms for example shares trading was not available in the mt platform which means some traders may have to shift from one application to the next in order to execute their strategies the minimum trade size in all platforms was limited to units but position sizing was very flexible as long as it was over units see platform walkthrough mobile experience the mobile trading platforms offer similar functionality to the desktop applications traders can access trading instruments complex order types watchlists and account analytics all from their mobile device the mobile platform also includes charts with price overlays indicators and flexible display styles prosthe mobile apps were easy to log in to and had good charting functionality the choice of technical indicators was limited but those that were available were customizable and easy to apply market lists and watchlists were also easy to find and edit even on a small screen consnews feeds and market analysis was launched outside the mobile app in the web browser we found it annoying to move back and forth between the charts and the news in two different apps although it was possible to enter advanced order types the process of typing in the prices was cumbersome on a small screen the mt mobile app was a little better in these respects than the custom mobile app see platform walkthrough customer support customer service was easy to reach and available during almost all market hours we had trouble getting fast answers via chat but overall the experience was good traders can access chat support through the custom client application which is convenient there are no local branches to visit in person and no accessibility services such as tdd tty are offered live chatemail what you need to knowphone support during market hours will be the most helpful support tool for most traders chat was slow but a convenient option if you aren t in a rush the customer service reps were courteous and easy to understand research insights forex com offers economic analysis real time news feeds calendars and advanced data analytics through all of their trading platforms the research and tools varied quite a bit from one trading platform to the next which could make for a fragmented trading experience if investors wanted to take advantage of all the tools available the online webinars discussing the live market were also good advanced chartingcharts include advanced studies display types and customizable timeframeslive trading webinarsanalysts hosted live trading webinars with commentary and actionable ideasreal time newsnews feeds accessible in or from all the desktop and mobile applicationseconomic analysisannouncement reporting analysis and calendars available through trading applications and on forex comresearch reportshigh quality research reports available on technical and fundamental factorsglobal research teamthe research team at forex com are credentialed professionals with global exposure prosnone of the platform offerings we evaluated from forex com were very unique in the market but the combination of all of them at the same broker was unusual that means investors have a lot of choices and flexibility which is valuable the broad spectrum of trading markets available are also attractive and having access to all of them through forex com s custom advantage trader is also convenient conswe would have liked to see the tradingview multicharts included in the custom advanced trader platform rather than only in the mobile application alternatively we would have liked to have seen all the available trading markets and advanced order types available in the web trading app this is useful for traders looking for more advanced charting although there was a lot of functionality in the custom platform some features like chat support and research were pulled in from the website which is not as convenient education the forex com website has education on forex trading platforms and technical and fundamental analysis the education section on the site is well organized and easy to find but there is no tracking of completed sections and it will be easy for investors to lose track of where they are in the process of learning while the education was good we found most of it to be very basic introductory level education is great for new traders getting started in the market but experienced users won t find much they don t already know webinars were good and the fact that they are held during market hours where live trading is discussed is a plus learn about market forces and currencyfundamentals of the forex markets education targeted at new forex traders analyze markets find opportunitiesplatform and tools education focused help for navigating the trading platforms and analytical tools think like a professionaltechnical analysis and strategy education provides background level education on technical analysis and demonstrations in the live market what you need to knowthe articles and videos on forex markets and on technical and fundamental analysis are good but the advanced section was a little light the webinars help fill the potential gap for some traders with more advanced questions almost all the education was focused on the forex markets so shares and cfd trading education would have to be found elsewhere which could be difficult for some investors bottom line forex com offered a comprehensive package of available markets and trading technology costs were average or a little better than the industry depending on the market the custom research available from forex com was above average and could help traders trying to understand how the markets are changing and where the real opportunities are the advantage trader platform was good and had the most robust order entry and available markets but we found the charts in the web trading app to be much better some investors may need to use more than one platform for their analysis and trading which is inconvenient but this was one of the only real issues we had with the broker customer service was good even if chat was a little slow reviewed by john jagerson january john jagerson has worked in the capital markets and private equity for
