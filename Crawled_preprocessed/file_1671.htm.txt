often billed as a banker s game currencies can sometimes be great diversification for a portfolio that might have hit a bit of a rut it s a market that can also offer tremendous opportunity when other global forums enter the doldrums as a result knowing a little bit about forex and the fundamentals behind it can make significant additions to any trader investor or portfolio manager s arsenal let s take a look at eight currencies every trader or investor should know along with the central banks of their respective nations u s dollar usd central bank federal reserve fed current interest rate information http www federalreserve gov releases h data htm the almighty dollar created in by the federal reserve act the federal reserve system also called the fed is the central banking body of the u s the system is itself headed by a chairman and board of governors with most of the focus being placed on the branch known as the federal open market committee fomc the fomc supervises open market operations as well as monetary policy or interest rates the current committee is comprised of five of the current federal reserve bank presidents and seven members of the federal reserve board with the federal reserve bank of new york always serving on the committee even though there are voting members non members including additional fed bank presidents are invited to share their views on the current economic situation when the committee meets every six weeks sometimes referred to as the greenback the u s dollar usd is the home denomination of the world s largest economy the united states as with any currency the dollar is supported by economic fundamentals including gross domestic product and manufacturing and employment reports however the u s dollar is also widely influenced by the central bank and any announcements about interest rate policy the u s dollar is a benchmark that trades against other major currencies especially the euro japanese yen and british pound for further reading about trading this currency see taking advantage of a weak u s dollar european euro eur central bank european central bank ecb current interest rate http www ecb int stats monetary rates html index en html the dollar s nemesis headquartered in frankfurt germany the european central bank is the central bank of the member countries of the eurozone in similar fashion to the united states fomc the ecb has a main body responsible for making monetary policy decisions the executive council which is composed of five members and headed by a president the remaining policy heads are chosen with consideration that four of the remaining seats are reserved for the four largest economies in the system which include germany france italy and spain this is to ensure that the largest economies are always represented in the case of a change in administration the council meets approximately times a year read more about how central banks control inflation in what are central banks in addition to having jurisdiction over monetary policy the ecb also holds the right to issue banknotes as it sees fit similar to the federal reserve policy makers can interject at times of bank or system failures the ecb differs from the fed in an important area instead of maximizing employment and maintaining stability of long term interest rates the ecb works towards a prime principle of price stability with secondary commitments to general economic policies as a result policymakers will turn their focus to consumer inflation in making key interest rate decisions although the monetary body is somewhat complex the currency is not against the u s dollar the euro eur tends to be a slower currency compared to its colleagues i e the british pound or australian dollar on an average day the base currency can trade between pips with more volatile swings averaging slightly more at pips wide per day another trading consideration is time because the fx market is open forex traders must strategically set fx trading schedules trading in the euro based pairs can be seen during the london and u s sessions which occur from am through am est japanese yen jpy central bank bank of japan boj current interest rate http www boj or jp en index htm technically complex fundamentally simple established as far back as the bank of japan serves as the central bank to the world s second largest economy it governs monetary policy as well as currency issuance money market operations and data economic analysis the main monetary policy board tends to work toward economic stability constantly exchanging views with the reigning administration while simultaneously working toward its own independence and transparency meeting times a year the governor leads a team of nine policy members including two appointed deputy governors the japanese yen jpy tends to trade under the identity of a carry trade component offering a low interest rate the currency is pitted against higher yielding currencies especially the new zealand and australian dollars and the british pound as a result the underlying tends to be very erratic pushing fx traders to take technical perspectives on a longer term basis average daily ranges are in the region of pips with extremes as high as pips to trade this currency with a little bit of a bite focus on the crossover of london and u s hours am am est british pound gbp central bank bank of england boe current interest rate http www bankofengland co uk the queen s currency as the main governing body in the united kingdom the bank of england serves as the monetary equivalent of the federal reserve system in the same fashion the governing body establishes a committee headed by the governor of the bank made up of nine members the committee includes four external participants appointed by the chancellor of exchequer a chief economist director of market operations committee chief economist and two deputy governors meeting every month of the year the monetary policy committee mpc decides on interest rates and broader monetary policy with primary considerations of total price stability in the economy as such the mpc also has a benchmark of consumer price inflation set at if this benchmark is compromised the governor has the responsibility to notify the chancellor of exchequer through a letter one of which came in as the u k cpi rose sharply to the release of this letter tends to be a harbinger to markets as it increases the probability of contractionary monetary policy a little bit more volatile than the euro the british pound gbp also sometimes referred to as pound sterling or cable tends to trade a wider range through the day with swings that can encompass pips it isn t unusual to see the pound trade as narrowly as pips swings in notable cross currencies tend to give this major a volatile nature with traders focusing on pairs like the british pound japanese yen and the british pound swiss franc as a result the currency can be seen as most volatile through both london and u s sessions with minimal movements during asian hours pm am est swiss franc chf central bank swiss national bank snb current interest rate http www snb ch en iabout stat statpub zidea id current interest exchange rates a banker s currency different from all other major central banks the swiss national bank is viewed as a governing body with private and public ownership this belief stems from the fact that the swiss national bank is technically a corporation under special regulation as a result a little over half of the governing body is owned by the sovereign states of switzerland it is this arrangement that emphasizes the economic and financial stability policies dictated by the governing board of the snb smaller than most governing bodies monetary policy decisions are created by three major bank heads who meet on a quarterly basis the governing board creates the band plus or minus basis points of where the interest rate will reside the euro and swiss franc have an interesting relationship similar to the euro the swiss franc chf hardly makes significant moves in the any of the individual sessions as a result look for this particular currency to trade in the average daily range of pips per day high frequency volume for this currency is usually pitted for the london session am am est canadian dollar cad central bank bank of canada boc current interest rate http www bankofcanada ca en rates interest look html the loonie established by the bank of canada act of the bank of canada serves as the central bank called upon to focus on the goals of low and stable inflation a safe and secure currency financial stability and the efficient management of government funds and public debt acting independently canada s central bank draws similarities with the swiss national bank because it is sometimes treated as a corporation with the ministry of finance directly holding shares despite the proximity of the government s interests it is the responsibility of the governor to promote price stability at an arm s length from the current administration while simultaneously considering the government s concerns with an inflationary benchmark of the boc has tended to remain a shade more hawkish rather than accommodative when it comes to any deviations in prices keeping in touch with major currencies the canadian dollar cad tends to trade in similar daily ranges of pips many currency prices and commodities move together and one unique aspect about the cad is its relationship with crude oil the country remains a major exporter of the commodity and as a result plenty of traders and investors use this currency as either a hedge against current commodity positions or pure speculation tracing signals from the oil market australian new zealand dollar aud nzd central bank reserve bank of australia reserve bank of new zealand rba rbnz current interest rate http www rba gov au and http www rbnz govt nz always a carry favorite offering one of the higher interest rates in the major global markets the reserve bank of australia has always upheld price stability and economic strength as cornerstones of its long term plan headed by the governor the bank s board is made up of six members at large in addition to a deputy governor and a secretary of the treasury together they work toward to target inflation between while meeting nine times throughout the year in similar fashion the reserve bank of new zealand looks to promote inflation targeting hoping to maintain a foundation for prices both currencies have been the focus of carry traders as the australian and new zealand dollars aud and nzd offer the highest yields of the seven major currencies available on most platforms as a result volatility can be experienced in these pairs if a deleveraging effect takes place otherwise the currencies tend to trade in similar averages of pips like other majors both currencies also maintain relationships with commodities most notably silver and gold south african rand zar central bank south african reserve bank sarb current interest rate http www reservebank co za emerging opportunity previously modeled on the united kingdom s bank of england the south african reserve bank stands as the monetary authority when it comes to south africa taking on major responsibilities similar to those of other central banks the sarb is also known as a creditor in certain situations a clearing bank and major custodian of gold above all else the central bank is in charge of the achievement and maintenance of price stability this also includes intervention in the foreign exchange markets when the situation arises interestingly enough the south african reserve bank remains a wholly owned private entity with more than shareholders that are regulated by owning less than of the total number of outstanding shares this is to ensure that the interests of the economy precede those of any private individual to maintain this policy the governor and member board head the bank s activities and work toward monetary goals the board meets six times a year seen as relatively volatile the average daily range of the south african rand zar can be as high as pips but don t let the wide daily range fool you when translated into dollar pips the movements are equivalent to an average day in the british pound making the currency a great pair to trade against the u s dollar especially when taking into consideration the carry potential traders also consider the currency s relationship to gold and platinum with the economy being a world leader when it comes to exports of both metals it is only natural to see a correlation similar to that between the cad and crude oil as a result consider the commodities markets
