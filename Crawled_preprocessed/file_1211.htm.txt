switching car insurance carriers we usually stay with the same insurer year after year the hassle and effort of leaving any company we are used to dealing is enough to prevent us from making a move moreover being bombarded with insurance ads and complex policy language can deter us from switching carriers that said making the switch is not only relatively easy but it can also save you money in the long run getting started the best place to start when considering a switch is the here the dmv s website will clearly outline the process to follow when considering a switch as the dmv notes it s important to be wary of flashy ads and to do the best you can to ensure that throughout the process you are not sacrificing quality for the price in short it s important to be an educated consumer before you start making calls and decisions make a list of priorities make a note of what s most important to you before you go shopping around for rates and policies this will equip you with a framework to use when you speak with agents and salesmen for example before you go shopping you should ask yourself the following questions what are your cost and coverage bundle expectations and limits how important is access to a live customer service representative how important is access to international policies having non negotiables in mind simplifies a process that can easily become complicated with the breadth of available competitors for example if having a designated rep that you can always speak to is what s important to you then you won t have to waste your time with companies you already know don t provide that call your current provider now it s time to get on the phone if you are already happy with your current company but are looking for better rates it s a good idea to call them first any company profiting from your business will be inclined to keep it and if you put your requests on the table it is likely they will do what they can to meet them your current insurance company may be able to adjust your premium based on life changes such as age marital status etc that can affect your rate there may also be many discounts with your current carrier you may qualify for that you weren t even aware of starting with your current provider also gives you a good sense of how easy or difficult it will be to get what you are looking for from here get at the very minimum two other quotes from companies that fit the bill of what you ultimately want from a carrier when doing so it s important to look them up with the better business bureau and look at their ratings the dmv notes that if they do not provide prompt and helpful service when you are looking for a quote they may not be easy to deal with in the event of a claim assess the overall cost of the switch as with any policy or contract there may be termination fees if you cancel the policy before the length of the contract is fulfilled if you find a new insurance carrier that can provide you lower rates but are hit with a sizable cancellation fee it might not make financial sense to make the switch if you can find lower rates better service and a termination fee that you can deal with though then it can be a smart move find out if there are ways you can avoid or waive the fee as each policy is different it s important to also formally end your policy with your current carrier halting the payment of premiums does not automatically terminate your policy in fact it can cause you financial burden in the future damage your credit and have you seeing accrued interest payments on top of a new policy make sure you formally and correctly cancel an old policy while obtaining a new one get written confirmation of your cancelation this protects you now and in the future from getting billed again by an old insurer make sure there are no gaps there are two different schools of thought on this one many believe you should start the new policy before you cancel your old one to ensure there are no coverage gaps others get out of the old policy first to prevent any double paying of premiums this is entirely dependent and subjective to each policy and different case the dmv does warn though that it can be illegal to drive in your state without insurance you are also exposed to major financial risk should an accident occur and the potential risk of future insurance companies finding out you drove without insurance and labeling you as high risk only to up your premiums again the decision is personal but it s a good idea to err on the side of caution with this one your company might require that you cancel your policy in writing as well check to see what their requirements are as each carrier is different some states require new insurance policies to be activated before current plans can be canceled the bottom line you do not have to wait for renewal or any specific time to switch your insurance the best time is when you feel like you have found a feasible alternative having a list of non negotiable items you are seeking in your new policy will best help you in making an educated decision there are many options when it comes to auto insurance which increases the risk of confusion and falling into a trap narrow it down to three choices compare their costs and make sure you are aware of the total cost of switching to a new policy dictionary
