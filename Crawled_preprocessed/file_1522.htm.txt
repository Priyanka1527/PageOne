appliances for a set period a home warranty is different from as home insurance breaking down home warranty when purchasing a home the buyer may not know how well the previous owners maintained and managed the components of the home information on the age of household appliances or their useful life in years may not be available at the time of purchase also the search for an expert handyman or service provider may be time consuming for the homeowner limited time coupled with the high costs associated with paying for damages or replacements on multiple components of the home are the two main reasons that home buyers purchase home warranties while a home warranty bears a resemblance to home insurance policies regarding premiums deductibles claims and liabilities both offer different services home warranties maintain the functionalities of household systems while home insurance covers loss of the home itself that may be due to fire or natural disasters home warranty coverage usually a home warranty plan covers major appliances like water heaters stoves and refrigerators it may also include systems such as hvac plumbing and electrical it is imperative to read the fine print of a warranty document to understand coverages and exclusions while some warranties cover garage door openers as part of the basic coverage plan others may require additional premium although it is possible to purchase additional coverage for a home feature not available with basic coverage it is also likely that some warranty companies do not cover specific components of a home for example some home warranty companies cover outdoor pools or spas for an additional premium to the policy whereas other companies may not warranty a pool on their offerings when an appliance or system is damaged the homeowner contacts the home warranty provider the warranty company usually works in unison with one or more home service providers such as plumbing or electrical contractors after notified of a claim the warranty company requests the services from one of its partnered providers who will assess damage and subsequently provide a report to the warrantor the assessment report reveals the extent and potential causes of damage to the appliance the home warranty company confirms if the policyholder s contract covers the appliance or system for the assessed damage if approved the warrantor employs the contractor to repair or replace the system home warranty denial of coverage home warranty providers may deny coverage for several reasons known damage existing before the start of warranty coverage may meet with denial of a claim for this reason if a home inspection conducted before purchase reveals damage to some systems or appliances the prospective buyer should request the seller repair or replace the item before finalizing the purchase of the home also a warranty company will not cover poorly maintained improperly installed or misused household components availability and costs homebuilders sellers and homeowners may purchase a home warranty some homebuilders offer policies that cover the structure up to ten years for structural defects structural defects include issues with flooring walls roofs framing sheetrock and other items homebuilder warranty may also cover two years of electrical and plumbing systems as well as six months for installed household appliances most often the cost of a homebuilder warranty policy is part of the price of the new house for older homes the seller or agent may pay for the warranty to incentivize a buyer to purchase the home warranties for existing homes typically cover a year of household systems and appliance maintenance after a year the homeowner has the option to renew the contract the cost for a home warranty ranges between to annually the policy s price depends on the homeowner s state of residence and the type of warranty product bought in addition to the annual premium homeowners will usually pay the servicing contractor a fee often called a service call fee or a trade call fee the contractor fee is synonymous with an insurance deductible depending on the provider the fee can range between approximately to most policies include the clause that if the cost of a repair or replacement is less than the fee the homeowner pays the lesser amount a new service fee will apply to each feature or system scheduled for maintenance for example if a homeowner s oven and refrigerator are both faulty they pay the contractor two separate trade fees finally if repair or replacement costs more than the home warranty contract limit the homeowner must cover the excess homeowners should analyze the offerings of home warranty companies to understand what out of pocket expenses they would be liable for in the event of a claim dictionary a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z content library articles terms videos tutorials slideshows faqs calculators chart advisor stock
