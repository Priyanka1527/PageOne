title h layout title h max width what does a balance transfer on a credit card mean simply it means moving the outstanding debt from one piece of plastic to another card usually a new one credit card balance transfers are typically used by consumers who want to move the amount they owe to a credit card with a lower interest rate fewer penalties or benefits such as rewards points or travel miles many credit card companies offer free balance transfers in order to entice people to choose their products over a competitor s as an additional sweetener they often offer a promotional or introductory period of anywhere from six to months federal law requires at least six in which no interest is charged on the transferred sum with proper diligence savvy consumers can take advantage of these incentives and avoid high interest rates while paying down debt but they need to study offers carefully as many credit transfers involve unexpected charges and other conditions that impact those great sounding terms how to do a credit card balance transfer if you ve been approved a new credit card with a interest balance transfer offer and make sure that anyone who is approved for the card will get the rate or if it depends on a credit inquiry here are the steps you ll want to take before you actually make the move and the steps for completing the transfer see where you stand and choose balances to transfer list all of your credit cards their balances and their interest rates choose one or more cards with high rates whose balances you d like to transfer to save money on interest the balance doesn t have to be in your name to qualify for a transfer so if your new spouse has a high interest credit card balance and you have excellent credit you might use a offer to help pay off his or her old balance and start over together debt free calculate your balance transfer fee note the balance transfer fee if there is one and calculate how much you ll pay on the amount you want to transfer the fee is typically to meaning you ll pay to or every you transfer even with the new lower interest rate will you still come out ahead after the balance transfer fee use an online balance transfer calculator to do the math also note if there s an amount cap on the fee if so that can really make transferring larger balances worthwhile say for example there s a balance transfer fee of up to a maximum of you transfer a balance of but because of the cap you don t pay of but an effective interest rate of only understand the penalties after the transfer you can t just forget about the balance and let it sit there for a year you still have to make the minimum monthly payment on the card before the due date to keep that rate if you miss one the balance may immediately start incurring interest pay attention to the interest rate you ll pay will it be a default rate that s higher than what you re paying now similarly if you default under any of the cardholder agreements such as making payments late going over your limit or bouncing a check the interest rate can jump to a penalty rate which could be as high as know when the promotion ends and what happens when it does the rate is usually valid for or months if you re planning to pay off a transferred balance during an introductory period calculate whether you re likely to be able to pay it in full during that time if not what interest rate will you pay when the introductory period ends and will you still come out ahead don t expect a reminder from the credit card company that your promotional rate is ending by the way it s hoping that you ll miss the deadline and have to start paying interest on your balance check the time limit for completing the transfer if you re getting a new credit card account the terms will require you to complete the balance transfer within a certain number of days usually one to two months to receive any promotional rate read the fine print carefully to see how big that window of time is complete the transfer the day after that window closes and you ll pay the regular interest rates make sure you meet the basic requirements for the balance transfer generally you cannot do a credit card balance transfer if your new account is with the same company as the card whose balance you want to pay off for example you cannot transfer a balance from one citibank credit card to another also if you have a past due payment with the creditor to which you want to transfer the balance or if you have filed for bankruptcy your transfer request may be declined decide how much to transfer check the credit limit on your new card you can t request a balance transfer for more than your available credit line and balance transfer fees count toward that limit for example if you have in available credit you won t be able to transfer a balance with a balance transfer fee you d need to have in available credit to complete the transaction the most you ll be able to transfer is around decide where you want the balance transfer funds to go do you want them to go directly to another creditor to pay off your balance do you want the funds deposited to your bank account so you can pay off other debts in the latter case make sure the credit card explicitly states that having funds deposited to your bank account will not be considered a cash advance if you accidentally take out a cash advance you ll pay interest on the transaction immediately and usually at a high rate request the balance transfer with your new creditor by following its specific instructions although it s called a balance transfer what s actually happening is you are using one credit card to pay off another one the mechanics look something like this balance transfer checks the new card issuer or issuer of the card you re transferring the balance to gives you checks simply make the check out to the card company you want to pay some credit card companies will even let you make the check out to yourself but again make sure this won t be considered a cash advance online or phone transfers have the name payment address and account number for the balance you re paying off with the amount you want to transfer for direct deposit have the bank account and routing number of the account into which you want to deposit the balance transfer funds watch your old and new accounts you might inquire if it s not stated anywhere about the transfer timeframe in any event allow at least two to three days and up to days for your new creditor to pay off your old creditor eyeball each old account whose balance you re paying off to see when the balance transfer clears in the meantime don t miss any payment deadlines on those accounts so you don t incur any late fees keep an eye too on your new account to see when the balance has transferred over especially if you want to use the card to make purchases balance transfer math no doubt about it a transfer can save you money say you have a balance on a credit card with a apr carrying that balance is costing you a year at this rate then you get a balance transfer offer on a new credit card with terms of interest for months you can move your balance to the new card and you ll have a whole year to pay it off with no interest you just have to pay a fee to transfer the balance which amounts to even after the fee you ll come out way ahead by not paying interest for a year as long as you put about per month toward your balance so that it s paid in full by the end of the promotional period what about transferring a balance if there s no interest rate offer is it worth the time and hassle it can be but do the math first say you have a balance with a interest rate at apr you re currently paying a year in interest you see a card with a apr and a transfer fee transferring your balance means you d be paying in interest a year add on the balance transfer fee and it s up to guess what a year you d about break even after a year in this example to come out ahead you d need to look for a deal where the apr is less than a better plan might be to ask your card issuer for an interest rate reduction to so you don t incur a fee a loss of grace while these credit card balance transfer offers look great on the surface people who take advantage of them might find themselves on the hook for unexpected interest charges the problem is that transferring a balance means carrying a monthly balance and carrying a monthly balance even one with a interest rate can mean losing the credit card s grace period and paying surprise interest charges on new purchases the grace period is the time between when your credit card billing cycle ends and when your credit card bill is due during which you don t have to pay interest on your purchases by law it must be at least days you only get the grace period if you aren t carrying a balance on your credit card what many consumers don t realize is that carrying a balance from doing a promotional balance transfer affects the grace period with no grace period if you make any purchases on your new credit card after completing your balance transfer you ll rack up interest charges on those purchases from the moment you make them when that happens some of the money you re saving by having a interest rate on the balance transfer will go right back out of your pocket a tough balancing act let s say you need to fork over for toilet paper paper towels and other household essentials during a routine shopping trip and you charge it to your new card the same card to which you ve transferred the balance you assume that if you pay the full when your bill comes due in three weeks you won t owe any interest on the purchase after all you just made it but when your credit card statement arrives you find you ve been charged apr your new card s interest rate on purchases on your purchase it s a small amount but there s the principle of the thing if you re going to pay interest or fees to a credit card company you want to do it knowingly not because the company caught you off guard it gets worse in your mind the amount you owe for the balance transfer and the amount you owe for purchases are separate just send in your payment for plus the or so in interest and you ve got your grace period back and everything is fine you think but if your credit card company applies payments to the lowest interest balances first your will go toward your balance transfer amount and your purchase will keep sitting there accruing interest at until you pay off your entire balance transfer your purchase and all the interest you ve accrued plus any more new charges will start incurring interest from the day you make them the only way to get the grace period back on your card and stop paying interest is to pay off the entire balance transfer as well as all your new purchases and if you had enough cash saved up to do that you probably wouldn t have done the balance transfer in the first place balance transfers to existing cards you don t have to open a new account to do a credit card balance transfer you can do it with an existing card especially if the issuer is running a special promotion transferring a balance over to a lower interest rate card is often a good idea even if your balance isn t paid off before the promotional rate expires on the balance transfer the remainder will be paid off at a lower interest rate however it can be tricky if you already have a balance on the card to which you are transferring more debt suppose that you owe on your credit card with a annual percentage rate apr before you transfer a balance of from your second card the balance transfer rate you are offered is for six months you pay off in six months but because the portion of your credit card debt is paid first you will be charged at the apr rate for six months for the that was untouched by payments meanwhile the card you transferred from has a rate of apr representing a loss of for you you could cost yourself money in interest paid and transfer charges by using a balance transfer offer in these circumstances you also need to consider what adding a big sum to a card will do to your credit utilization ratio that is the percentage of a consumer s available credit that he or she has used which is a key component of your credit score say you have a card with a limit with a balance you are using of your credit limit then you transfer creating a total balance of you are now using of your credit limit this increase in your balance on one card could hurt your credit score and ultimately cause the interest rate to rise on this and other cards balance transfer vs personal loan some financial advisors feel credit card balance transfers only make sense if you can pay off all or most of the debt during the promotional rate period after the promotional period ends you are likely to face another high interest rate on your balance in which case a personal loan whose rates tend to be lower and or fixed is probably the cheaper option however if the personal loan has to be secured you may not be comfortable pledging assets as collateral credit card debt is unsecured and if you default on it it s unlikely that the card issuer will sue you and come after your assets that changes when you open a secured personal loan the company can take the asset to recoup its loan if you can t make the payments where to look if you d like to do more research there are several credit card comparison websites that can help you find the best balance transfer credit card for your situation creditcards com cardhub com bankrate com nerdwallet com creditkarma com current promotions the chart below outlines top balance transfer promotions offered by card companies based on the length of the apr offer period and the sizes of the transfer fee and post promotion transfer apr best balance transfer credit card offers credio note this is an interactive chart so you can click on an individual card to get more details or click on view full comparison to get even more information about how the cards compare when consulting any credit card comparison website be aware that these sites typically get referral fees from the credit card companies when a customer applies for a card through the website s affiliate link and is approved take any rankings with a grain of salt too also some credit card companies have influenced the information that websites post about their cards in a way that means you might not be getting an accurate picture of a card s costs be sure to read the fine print at the creditor s website before you apply for any card the bottom line transferring a credit card balance should be a tool to help you get out of debt faster and spend less money on interest without incurring charges or hurting your credit report if you understand the fine print outlining the terms sometimes these statements aren t even in the credit card offer itself but elsewhere on the credit card issuer s website such as in a help faq or customer service area do the math before applying to make sure you ll come out ahead and create a repayment plan you can stick with grabbing a interest offer on a new card could be a shrewd move however you might consider treating that transfer as a loan don t use the card for any purchases until you ve completely paid off the balance transfer if you want to be able to spend with it then try to find a credit card that offers a introductory apr for the same number of months on both balance transfers and new
