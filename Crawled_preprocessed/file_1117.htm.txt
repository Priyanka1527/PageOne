our ratings it was with trust it s worth noting however that most of the reason for this was the company s lack of compensation above and beyond what s required by regulators in the event of a default by ig however while ig does not provide additional deposit insurance it does take steps to ensure client funds are not comingled with corporate funds ensuring that client money and assets are protected in the unlikely event that ig becomes insolvent by holding those funds in segregated accounts at regulated banks the gambling commission classifies the way ig holds client money as high

to automate your trading and bypass ig and go directly to the market makers and even use your own or a third party trading platform we are impressed with the number of trading platforms and tools that

watchlists and dynamic charts the amount of information you can apply to the charts indicators drawings economic events and more while maintaining a clean organized layout even when toggling back and forth between chart time frames and single and multi chart layouts is perhaps the most impressive aspect of the platform some traders may gravitate toward ig s mt charting package or one of the other advanced charting packages for the special features they offer but most traders are going to find everything they need in ig s online browser based trading platform proseverything in the online trading platform is customizable from the color of the platform to the positioning and number of charting news and portfolio windows you can also trade forex indices individual shares commodities

platform to track progress and lessons learned prosig provides a wide range of analytics research and tools we especially liked the client sentiment tool and the dynamic charts the economic calendar was easy to use integrated into the trading platform and included expectations actual results currencies affected and historical data research from ig s analysts was timely and informative consthe economic calendar provides timely data for the current trading day but it lacks the ability to go forward or backward in time to see what is coming in the future or what has happened in the past the pop up data windows that appear when you click on a specific economic event are also broken education ig s education via its ig academy is well organized and comprehensive it is even available in a

educational opportunities necessary to get started seasoned traders will appreciate the flexible customizable trading platforms and low trading costs the firm covers a broad array of financial markets
