higher signaling a temporary pause in upward momentum also referred to as a retracement or consolidation breaking down pullback pullbacks are widely seen as buying opportunities after a security has experienced a large upward price movement for example a stock may experience a significant rise following a positive earnings announcement and then experience a pullback as traders take profit off the table the positive earnings however suggests that the stock will resume its uptrend most pullbacks involve a security s price moving to an area of technical support such as a moving average or pivot point before resuming their uptrend traders should carefully watch these key areas of support since a breakdown from them could signal a reversal rather than a pullback some traders refer to pullbacks as retracements or consolidations which have largely the same meaning pullbacks vs reversals pullback and reversals both involve a security moving off of its highs but pullbacks are temporary and reversals are longer term how do you distinguish the two most reversals involve some change in a security s underlying fundamentals that force the market to reevaluate its value for example a company may report disastrous earnings that make investors recalculate a stock s net present value in the futures market a downturn in automotive demand could lead to lower demand for steel and other commodities which would be expected to continue over a long period of time in contrast pullbacks typically don t change the underlying fundamental narrative they are usually profit taking opportunities following a strong run up in a security s price for example a company may report blow out earnings and see shares jump the stock may experience a pullback the next day as short term traders lock in profits but the strong earnings report suggests that the stock is still headed higher over the long term examples of pullbacks every stock chart has examples of pullbacks within the context of a prolonged uptrend while these pullbacks are easy to spot in retrospect they can be harder to assess for investors holding a security that s losing value in the example above the spdr s p etf spy experiences four pullbacks within the context of a prolonged trend higher these pullbacks typically involved a move to near the day moving average where there was technical support before a rebound higher traders should be sure to use several different technical indicators when assessing pullbacks to ensure that they don t turn into longer term reversals the bottom line pullbacks are widely seen as buying opportunities after a security has experienced a large upward price movement they shouldn t be confused with reversals which tend to be longer term downtrends where there has been a change in fundamentals traders should be sure to use technical analysis to verify that a pullback remains above key support levels to avoid possible longer term reversals that could result in
