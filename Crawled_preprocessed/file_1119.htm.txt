clients established milliongain capital holdings client assets as of december trading instruments products fees spread betting and cfd trading with city index is commission free except for cfd trading in shares the commissions for shares cfds are more expensive than average and the minimum charges are high additional spread is added to the market rate for spread betting on shares the spreads are tight on indices and forex better than the market average it s worth noting that forex is not traded on the spot market but rather as a cfd or spread bet overall city index is competitive on certain markets but not on others however it does provide an excellent selection of tradable products including shares commodities forex indices bonds and bitcoin account deposits and withdrawals are free in most cases be aware that there s a gbp per month inactivity fee on accounts inactive for months or more eur usd pips gbp usd pips usd jpy pips s p cfd points ftse point wti crude oil gold points u s treasury notes points bitcoin from cfds u k shares gbp minimum cfds european shares gbp minimum cfds u s shares minimum spreads can vary based on volatility trust trust is where city index fares worst in our rating system because of its lack of protections beyond what is required by regulators for example there are no second layer security options like two factor authentication and the site does not use encrypted cookies however city index does have more than years of experience as a trading provider and is part of gain capital holdings a publicly traded company listed on the new york stock exchange gbp default insurance city index if city index defaults any shortfall of funds of up to gbp may be compensated for under the financial services compensation scheme fscs what you need to knowcity index is a trademark of gain capital uk limited all retail clients money is kept segregated from city index s funds in separate accounts compensation of up to gbp may be available to clients in the event of liquidation through the financial services compensation scheme fscs the financial conduct authority fca fully regulates and authorizes city index special features city index offers several different platforms for private investors and traders these include mobile applications for android and ios a web browser based platform an advanced downloadable desktop platform and the

research markets and open or close trades when needed on their chosen device metatrader accounts are separate focused on forex and will not sync with city index s other platforms some clients might require additional tools for trading and research such as more fundamental information or technical indicators but overall the platforms offerings are solid city index does not allow money management

are lots of different chart types and time frame options and you can have multiple charts open at the same time in different sizes consthere is a slight lag to the charts on the advantage web platform when you zoom in and out or adjust a chart if you want to view regulatory news on stocks you may need to use other sources as only reuters news articles are available on the city index platforms customization of the advantage web platform is limited to the layout as the colors can t be changed unfortunately volume data is not available for any tradable assets on any platform recognia a research portal can be accessed from the at pro and advantage web platforms but opens as a separate page there s no button to quickly add a trade idea found on the research portal to your watchlist on the platform see platform walkthrough mobile experience there are two mobile trading platforms to choose from the city index app and the metatrader app both of which are available for ios and android devices the city index app will sync with the at pro and advantage web desktop platforms the metatrader app syncs only with the metatrader desktop platform trades can be opened closed monitored and

responsive when navigating your way around looking at charts placing trades setting alerts or creating watchlists all charts are in real time and there are many different options for chart types time frames and indicators the city index app also syncs with the desktop platforms at pro and advantage web the metatrader app is fast and responsive shares many of the features of the desktop version and syncs to it both mobile platforms allow clients to trade while on the go if they are connected to the internet and have an android or ios smartphone or tablet consyou cannot log in to city index on a mobile web browser only through an app this may be an issue if you were using somebody else s mobile device and didn t want the hassle of downloading and installing the app there is no option at this time for fingerprint login and you can t reach the recognia portal through the city index app see platform walkthrough customer support city index has a good support network in place for both existing and prospective clients its client services team is available monday through friday by online chat phone or email live chatemailtwitter what you need to knowlive chat can be started by clicking the

analystsget insights from city index s global research analysts proscity index has some useful research tools like its economic calendar and earnings release dates that can help you plan for the trading week ahead using charts and reading price action is a major aspect of research for many traders city index offers a broad range of global markets and all the charts on its platforms are in real time and free even for demo accounts the charts are easy to use and customizable with different indicators time frames and drawing tools trade ideas may be found using the different sections of the recognia research portal conswhile the research tools are acceptable many traders might prefer to use other sources with more extensive or specific tools for example there are two separate screeners one fundamental and one technical you cannot combine the two and the criteria you can choose from for each are limited the fundamental and financial information for stocks is also limited and you can t see a company s regulatory news unfortunately city index does not offer a volume indicator a popular tool that s incorporated into many trading strategies traders who want to use volume will need to use charts elsewhere education there is a lot of educational material on city index s website covering a range of topics for both new and experienced traders topics include introductions to spread betting and cfd trading as well as the various tradable markets such as shares forex indices commodities and bitcoin there is also content around building trading strategies such as planning

from there links to relevant educational content can be found throughout city index s website and there s also a search box so finding what you need is usually quite easy bottom line city index is a user friendly spread betting and cfd trading provider with tradable markets opening an account is easy and there are no minimum deposit requirements all the trading platforms are free and there is no charge to deposit or withdraw funds other benefits include being able to go short as well as long access to margin guaranteed stop losses demo accounts and free real time charts commissions for trading cfd shares are quite expensive but city index is competitive on trading costs in other areas such as forex and indices the large selection of spread betting markets will appeal to clients from the u k and other countries where trading them is tax free city index is not available to u s or canadian clients because of their countries financial regulations however residents of most countries around the world can open an account it s a shame city index doesn t offer a volume indicator and it would be good if it could add two factor authentication for extra security overall though city index is a good all around trading provider for both beginners and advanced traders reviewed by darren brazer january about our broker review methodology investopedia s mission is to provide online
