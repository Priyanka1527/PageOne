future movements in the price of a stock in most technical analysis models a crossover is a signal to either buy or sell on the chart below the stock falls below its day moving average a bearish sign breaking down crossover an example of a crossover would be when the security line breaks through its day moving average which may be a signal to buy the stock some of the indicators that use crossovers are moving averages and bollinger bands technical analysis utilizes crossovers to indicate general buy or sell signals on the underlying financial instruments traders use crossovers with various technical indicators to track turning points in price trends momentum volatility money flow and sentiment moving average crossovers trigger breakouts and breakdowns moving average crossoverswhen utilizing moving averages crossovers can determine a change in the price trend a common trend reversal technique is utilizing a five period simple moving average with a period simple moving average when the five period moving average forms a crossover through the period moving average it signals a reversal in the trend and potentially the start of a new opposite trend which is called a breakout or a breakdown a five period moving average crossing up through the period moving average indicates a price breakout that should form an uptrend composed of higher highs and higher lows a five period moving average crossover down through the period moving averages signals a price breakdown that should start a new downtrend composed of lower highs and lower lows the rule of thumb is that longer time frame periods result in stronger lasting signals a daily chart time period is stronger than a one minute chart time period the trade off is that the shorter time period crossovers give earlier signals but have many more false signals when the daily period moving average makes a crossover through the daily period moving average this is often known as the death cross which signals a major price trend reversal stochastic crossoversthe stochastic indicator measures the momentum of an underlying financial instrument it gauges the immediate overbought or oversold condition
