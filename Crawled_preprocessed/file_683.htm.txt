article helpful share bonds and bond funds are often perceived as being safe investments and buyers typically incorporate them into a portfolio hoping to generate consistent income without the volatility of the stock market however fixed income instruments have many risks beyond the issuer s credit quality and it is important to understand how a bond s duration will cause the price to fluctuate with interest rates duration defined investopedia defines duration as a measure of the sensitivity of the price the value of principal of a fixed income investment to a change in interest rates more specifically duration is a number that tells us how much a bond s price will change based on a shift in interest rates duration is measured in years and as an example a bond with a year duration will go up or down by about for every basis point percentage point change in interest rates the longer the bond and the lower the interest payment the higher the duration the formula for duration is complex but you do not need to calculate it yourself every bond fund must list its average duration and you can use this investopedia calculator to determine the duration on an individual bond managing duration risk this concept is particularly important for bond investors in a low interest rate environment first it is critical to remember that past performance is not a predictor of future results this often used phrase is particularly true of bond funds that maintain a portfolio with a long duration bond prices move inversely to interest rates and over the last couple decades long term interest rates have gone consistently lower this has caused value of the bonds to consistently shift higher as a hypothetical example a portfolio of bonds with interest rates and year durations would have increased in price by approximately as market rates moved from down to this return is capital appreciation and not income this distinction is important because if interest rates go back up to the bond or bond fund would give up those capital gains and the price would retreat back down stated differently the price of a bond like a stock can go down in value the higher the duration the more volatile the price second in a low interest rate environment investors tend to search out new sources of higher income this is often called stretching for yield savers that would have traditionally bought short term cds may go into junk bonds with lower credit quality or longer maturity bonds with higher durations in an effort to boost returns this stretching when done imprudently can create a portfolio that is poorly aligned with the investor s long term goals and risk tolerance forget price i m going to hold to maturity often times investors justify investing in longer bonds also known as going out further on the yield curve by saying something like i don t care how much the price moves since i don t plan on selling the bond although this statement may be true it isn t particularly helpful for managing duration risk as an example let us assume an investor buys a of a government bond that pays a coupon every year the bond will pay the bondholder when the bond matures the bondholder will get back the he put in now assume that interest rates go up to and the new bonds being issued by the government pay per year if the investor s bond has years until maturity the price on the statement will go down by nearly the annual difference between the interest payments multiplied over the remaining years with adjustments for the bond s cash flows so yes the investor never sold and made every year for years but his income was nearly lower than it could have been had he been able to reinvest at the higher rates more importantly if inflation skyrocketed and the change in rates was rather than the long term bond buyer would have locked in a negative real return with very little liquidity to take advantage of the more favorable market conditions for this reason it is very important that a bond investor manages duration risk by balancing longer bonds with positions that are less interest rate sensitive in this way if interest rates rise the investor would maintain the liquidity to take advantage of higher rates if rates stay the same or go lower the longer bonds will provide steady income and positive returns into the future disclaimer this
