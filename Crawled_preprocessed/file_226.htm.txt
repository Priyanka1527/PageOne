is easier than ever nowadays every reputable company has an investor relations section on its website that is a wealth of information walt disney co is an excellent example of a business that uses its website to get information out to shareholders and prospective investors it is very easy to find the link to its investor relations section this part of the disney website contains a downloadable version of its annual report stock quotes an investor newsletter archived conference calls and even the opportunity for current shareholders to sign up for electronic reports the best part about these online investor relations sections is their extra nuggets of hard to find information for example most companies will use these spaces to offer detailed info on past acquisitions and stock splits not
