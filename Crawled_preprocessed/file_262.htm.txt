have an opposite relationship with each other imagine a seesaw with bond prices at one end and interest rates at the other when interest rates go up bond prices go down and vice versa how bonds work bonds are investments which allow governments and corporations to borrow money from investors for a specific amount of time at a variable or fixed interest rate with most types of bonds the investor receives income based on the amount invested and the interest rate for example a bond purchased for will generate per year for the investor to understand why interest rates and bond prices work in opposite directions think about real life investors example when rates rise if investor a buys a year corporate bond from the issuer of the bond she will receive the bond s interest rate as income over the lifetime of the bond and will receive her principal back when the bond matures that translates to invested annual income and returned at maturity for related reading see interest rates and your bond investments if interest rates go up to the bond becomes less valuable due to what an investor expects when they buy a bond if investor b wants to buy a corporate bond he can now buy a year corporate bond directly from the issuer for or he can buy investor a s bond from her in the marketplace if he buys a year bond from the issuer for he will receive annual income he would have no reason to pay to buy investor a s bond since her bond generates less income each year if investor a wants to sell her bond she will need to sell it at a discount in the marketplace investor b expects to make on his bond x years total income since investor a will only make on her bond x years she may need to discount her bond by as much as to make it enticing for investor b to buy it from her example when rates fall the opposite is true if interest rates drop to if investor b wants to buy a year corporate bond after the rate falls to he would be willing to pay more than to buy investor a s bond from her instead of buying the bond directly from the issuer the greater the change in interest rates the greater the change in bond values additionally longer maturity bonds can experience bigger shifts in prices let s return to investor a if the interest rate goes up to in year two of her year bond the bond price will likely drop more than it would if the rate goes up to in year nine the reason is that in year two the bond still has eight years of uncertainty and possible price change however in year nine the bond is within one year of maturity which means that the par value or the face value of the bond will be paid back to the owner of the bond on the maturity date the bottom line interest rates and bond prices have an inverse relationship with each other understanding why and how can
