conquer the virtual world without the bounds of a local presence and physical locations internet based businesses continue to garner higher valuations with innovative offerings and expansion into global markets for more see how to start an online business we look at the world of internet business and at an etf that offers a single means to invest in the largest u s internet companies for more see the industry handbook the internet industry internet businesses the internet based business sector is broadly divided into two categories commerce companies and services companies the former generate the majority of their revenues by providing goods and or services through an online network while the latter generate the majority of their revenues by providing access to the internet and or content or by providing services to individuals or organizations using the internet search engines like google and yahoo online shopping portals ebay and amazon hosting services rackspace online media content providers netflix and even online financial services e trade derive their business from the internet investing in internet businesses investors can buy stocks of such internet companies and benefit from the high valuations however stock specific risk continues to haunt such an investment for example consider the performance of a few major internet based businesses like amazon com inc amzn twitter inc twtr and rackspace hosting inc rax over the last three years as displayed in the graph source google finance an investor who opted for amazon would have managed to double his money with returns while the unfortunate ones who selected twitter or rackspace would have been sitting at a loss of and respectively picking the right stocks at the right time at the right price level remains a challenge for common investors additionally picking multiple stocks also results in high transaction costs as each specific trade costs money mutual funds and exchange traded funds etfs offer a solution to the problem they pool in money from thousands of investors and create a large capital corpus it is then used to invest in multiple stocks based on a defined theme like internet company stocks experienced fund managers select stocks backed by detailed research and analysis in essence an investor may simply purchase mutual fund units at end of the day nav price and get the benefits of diversification professional money management and low transaction costs for more see how a mutual fund works exchange traded funds offer the dual benefits of diversification of mutual funds and real time tick by tick trading of a stock etfs usually follow a passive investment strategy most common of which includes replicating the holdings of an index for more see an introduction to exchange traded funds etfs video a fund or an etf that invests in stocks of online businesses might offer the right fit the first trust dow jones internet index fund fdn etf is one such etf that invests in u s based internet companies let s explore the details of this etf the fdn etf tracks the underlying benchmark index called the dow jones internet composite index djinet see index factsheet an index is a single number indicating the collective valuation of a selected basket of stocks positive or negative changes to the index are an indicator of how that particular basket of stocks is performing the djinet index represents the basket of largest and most actively traded stocks of the largest u s based companies in the internet industry to qualify for inclusion in the index a listed company must generate at least half of its business revenue from the internet additionally it should have a three month average market cap of at least million and a three month average closing price of at least all these requirements ensure that only the most valuable companies in the internet business make way to the index index constitution all companies operating in the internet commerce and services sectors and matching the above criteria are identified the float adjusted market capitalization value is calculated for each market capitalization or simply market cap is calculated as number of total shares current share price float adjusted indicates that only shares available to investors for trading in the open market are counted leaving aside the shares held by governments promoters or other companies float adjusted market capitalization value thereby indicates the value of a company at any given point in time the list is arranged in the descending order of the float adjusted market cap values the constituents of the index are reviewed for any changes on quarterly basis in a rebalancing exercise during such rebalancing the companies no longer qualifying for the top are knocked off the index and replaced by new entrants this rebalancing takes place on the third friday of march june september and december it ensures that the index adheres to the most recent top internet companies in terms of valuations inside the index each constituent company is assigned a weight within the index this is calculated by dividing the market cap of the individual constituent company by the sum of market caps of all constituent companies that is the market cap of entire index sum of all constituent weights adds up to one or let s understand the weight and its significance with a simple example assume there are companies each with million market cap companies each with million market cap and remaining companies each have a million market cap the total market cap of all companies will come to million million million million the top companies each having market cap of million will get an index weight of million million next companies each having market cap of million will get an index weight of million million and the last companies each having market cap of million will get an index weight of the sum total of all index weight would add to one or companies this individual company weight indicates the extent to which change in price of a company stock can move the index value if the market cap of a company which has an index weight of increases by it will increase the index value by a similar change of in market cap of a company having only index weight will increase the index value by only in essence the larger a company in terms of market cap the more index weight it has and the more influence it has on overall index value changes to prevent one or a few heavyweight company severely impacting the index valuation each company weight in the dow jones internet composite index is capped at as the prices of all constituent companies continuously change during trading sessions the value of the index is calculated every three minutes during u s stock exchange trading hours this assists in having the benchmark index values available for real time comparison with the etf valuation historical performance following the peak of during the dotcom boom around mid the dotcom bubble bust took the index to its lowest value of around during october since early this index has seen a regular and consistent increase indicating the growth of internet businesses from index to etf we ve seen how the basket of top u s internet based company stocks is configured in the index and how its value moves with changes in the prices of the constituent companies in simple terms the fdn etf tries to replicate the performance of the underlying benchmark index mentioned above it attempts to do so by investing a minimum of of the capital into the stocks of the underlying index in the same weight as that in the index the remaining or less capital is retained in cash or highly liquid money market instruments to facilitate the daily requests for creation allocation of new shares or redemption this fund was started on june with the starting nav value of and was trading at in early september it has a low expense ratio of and has achieved a morningstar rating of five stars its comparative performance with the index indicates that it has managed to replicate the underlying index to a good extent there is a minor deviation between the performance of fdn fund and the djinet index as visible in the gap between the red and blue graphs this is due to the fact that entire of fund capital is not invested in the index constituents and there are transactional costs in fund operations absent in index this constitutes the tracking error which indicates the difference between the performance of a fund and its underlying benchmark index for more see how can i calculate the tracking error of an etf or indexed mutual fund fund v s individual constituent stocks the fdn etf has scored well in tracking the underlying index but how did it perform compared to the individual constituent stocks the recent top holdings of the etf include google inc googl facebook inc fb amazon com inc amzn ebay inc ebay the priceline group inc pcln and salesforce com inc crm in last five years the above comparative chart indicates that the fdn has achieved its intended objective of closely representing the mixed basket of the top internet stocks it may not have performed as well as the priceline group inc or amazon com but it did not perform as badly as facebook inc during mid to mid it fits in between which is indeed the objective of the fund the bottom line the fdn fund offers a great way to diversify into internet sector with one single investment though it has performed well investors should not forget the risk factors investing in this fund is essentially making a bet on internet based businesses which are highly correlated to each other most of the constituent stocks belong to small and mid sized companies that are susceptible to price volatility adverse impacts of economic changes and limited liquidity the technology sector has its own intrinsic risks including rapidly changing technologies short life cycles intense competition and a concentration of u s based companies internet savvy investors can consider investing a limited portion of their portfolio into this fund stocks fdn trending a stock sell off
