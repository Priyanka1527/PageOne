review specific commissions and fees which vary greatly across instruments the browser platform uses adobe flash technology which is no longer supported by chrome or mobile devices microsoft and adobe will also cease support in many security and privacy advocates recommend disabling or uninstalling this program which has been a well documented conduit for malware in addition the platform manual

unsecured web trading platform based on adobe flash technology that is no longer supported by many browsers adobe support is scheduled to be discontinued in the platform s manual hasn t been updated since february indicating possible neglect in providing needed updates while adding to security concerns in addition the platform provides no secondary log in verification layer through smartphone or token mobile platforms may offer more secure alternatives because modern android and ios apps do not run flash technology special features the barclays trading hub website is surprisingly bare bones with typical marketing materials but limited educational and research resources cfd and spread betting faqs are useful but rudimentary while educational and research sections haven t been updated in several months the same holds true for a single social trading page listing the most common trades made by clients with the last entry on july two primary web pages simply direct viewers into other venues barclays direct investment service called smart investor and saxo capital markets which provides access to international equities guaranteed stop orderenhanced order executiondemo account day trial with gbp in virtual fundsinsightslearn and research the markets what you need to knowguaranteed stop orders which require an additional fee lower the odds for executions outside the published spreads the website s insight section promises powerful trading tools the very latest research and professional level analysis but many sections haven t been updated for months the learning sub section currently contains just four entries a video based platform tutorial two trading examples and a report on japanese assets desktop experience the proprietary adobe flash based platform provides a rudimentary trade entry terminal with basic charting news and research limited order types reduce trader flexibility and security issues raise red flags variable spread minimums make it difficult to project final costs for winning and losing positions prosthe easy to navigate proprietary platform gets new traders up and running quickly while context menus allow quick access to news and alert management markets are segmented by broad categories and countries of origin while a trending markets section identifies fast moving opportunities diverse cfd and spread betting choices in bonds interest rates and metals supplement more traditional equity index and commodity offerings the platform manual is well structured easy to read and augmented with hyperlinks to help traders develop skill consthe platform does not meet modern web security standards or provide the comprehensive menu of features found in the industry standard metatrader the security issues and dated web pages are especially troubling considering the bank s international scope and reputation it s also unclear why gain capital is providing the dealing and clearing on top of a barclays shell given the bank s massive resources see platform walkthrough mobile experience well organized mobile trading platforms for ios android blackberry and windows devices offer functionality similar to the desktop version s users can place trades analyze charts customize watchlists set alerts and view the latest market news accounts can be funded and managed directly through the applications which support monthly statement look up and display prosmobile apps offer industry standard features in an easy to navigate format menu choices are robust allowing customers to perform most desktop operations new users can build skills through getting started and new features buttons as well as help and feedback functionality trades can be placed with a single click on well organized watchlists a top level cash margin p l and balance window keeps track of short term performance a close all positions button allows quick risk management in highly volatile or adverse market conditions conshelp functionality is limited as information on many platform categories is missing the new features section isn t dated and therefore could be providing stale information platform settings include an activity timeout but there is no second security layer through token or authentication procedure which means the auto resume feature may be inherently insecure exposing the account if the device is stolen or hacked simplified trading screens don t offer more complex entry types including trailing stops charting offers limited indicator feature set no tick charts and a minute minimum view see platform walkthrough customer support barclays trading hub provides telephone email and postal support for cfd and spread betting but offers no chat or in person access frequently asked questions faqs are limited to cfd and spread betting topics and do not cover broader account issues fee structures or unusual funding withdrawal protocols a platform context menu for example reveals that a phone call is required to withdraw funds no web based withdrawal and funds will be returned only through the same method as account funding twitteremail what you need to knowtelephone support is provided between gmt sunday and gmt friday covering the majority of world market trading hours while faqs are provided for basic cfd and spread betting topics there are no faqs or knowledge base outlining broad account issues in addition the most important client specific information is buried within legal documents that many customers will find indecipherable research insights the insight section promises powerful trading tools through six subsections but most haven t been updated in several months basic chart lookback periods and indicators are adequate for research and strategy building compassmonthly publication with information about investment strategy and reviewsbarclays blogweekly industry and sector expert commentary and opinions sent directly to clientsstock market news and commentaryprovided by gain

time world index quotes includes ftse chartplatform market reportmarket based contextual data prosthe news features are broad based and adequate insight sections of the website would provide value if updated the basic platform charting works as intended with a variety of basic indicators enhancing research chart settings are saved between sessions and within custom workplaces consthe website s research sections have not been updated for months without explanation platform context based research reveals an economic calendar and nothing else charting provides no special features extended lookback periods or alternative display options there s no feature to save news by ticker symbol or to receive custom news alerts education learning facilities are well below industry standards a single website learning portal offers just four items including a trading platform video tutorial the platform interface contains just a single educational asset another platform video tutorial trading platform tutorialsget up to speed platform tutorial for interfaces cfd trade workflowscfd trading examplestrading on japanexplore japanese assets what you need to knowlearning sections offer limited materials that follow no specific theme other than how to use the trading platform a single article on japan for example feels out of place given that there are none on any other geographic zones the platform manual offers a list of tutorial videos but contains just one entry an alternative trading platform tutorial that page lists three other videos with dead white space to be filled later the bottom of the manual states it was last updated in february bottom line barclays bank s cfd and spread betting platform has been neglected surprising given the bank s international scope and resources an unsecured trading platform using hackable technology no longer supported by major browsers raises a red flag as does a research portal that hasn t been updated in months the platform manual hasn t been updated since february further suggesting that barclays has dropped the ball funding limitations highlighted by the outdated need to call customer service to make withdrawals add to a user s sense of discomfort clearly there are better choices for aspiring cfd and spread betting traders reviewed by alan farley january alan farley is a private trader and author of the mcgraw hill
